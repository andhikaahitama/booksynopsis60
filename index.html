The terms of the inheritance dictate that he must care for his dead uncle&#39;s cormorant. It&#39;s just a bird, but in the eyes of this man and his family, the cormorant looms as a relentless, malign presence -- &#34;as ugly and poisonous as a vampire bat&#34; -- and seems to draw the small boy under its spell. A tightly written, erotically charged drama about people who do not know themselves and cannot come to terms with the natural world and its inescapable strangeness.Uncle Ian's strange bequest comes as a "thunderbolt of good fortune" to a young family when he leaves his nephew a rundown cottage not far from the coast in North Wales. But there is a condition: Uncle Ian's pet cormorant must be cared for. Though Ian's nephew (through whose eyes we observe this sinister tale) and his wife Anne settle in happily to their new life, they are soon disconcerted by the arrival of the bird, "as ugly and poisonous as a vampire bat." Anne shudders at its "demonic arrogance," but their 11-month-old son, Harry, is unpleasantly attracted to the bird, whom they name Archie. As a feeling of impending disaster gradually permeates the narrative, Archie's relentless presence causes a rift between the couple, who must cope with its viciousness and malevolence. The nephew finally decides to do away with Archie, but the cormorant proves to be his nemesis instead. This artful first novel, reminiscent of the tales of Poe, won Britain's Somerset Maugham Award. Gregory uses a low-key style and subtle lyricism to build an atmosphere of nightmarish horror in a tale that could become a classic. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oasis of Wisdom: The Worlds of the Desert Fathers and Mothers</h2><p><p>The life and wisdom of the desert fathers and mothers is not only retained in historical volumes, but has been a constant presence throughout the development of the church. A formative influence since the time of the early Christians, this wisdom has the power to transform and nurture even today.</p><p>Using six fundamental aspects of desert monastic life as windows - The Cell, Patience, Praxis, Labor and Time, Solitude and Silence, and Humility - <i>Oasis of Wisdom</i> reveals the world that created the wisdom of early Christian monastic men and women. With this experiential approach to learning, Keller goes beyond simple reflection by providing substantial historical background, including the environment of solitude, ascetic disciplines, labor, and daily life experiences. Touching on the social, religious, political, and linguistic influences of the culture, it is an ideal introduction for modern readers with limited backgrounds in theology or church history.</p><p><i>Oasis of Wisdom</i> is ideal for those seeking spiritual mentoring or a discipline of prayer, and will appeal to those from all denominations and backgrounds, from those new to church history to oblates. The richness of this ancient wisdom will challenge modern Christians to catch the spirit of the desert elders and join in their struggle to live an authentic human life.</p><p>Chapters are: Politeia: The Monastic World of the Desert Fathers and Mothers," *Oikoumene: The Inhabited World Surrounding the Desert Fathers and Mothers, - *Sunrise to Sunrise: The Daily Lives of Early Egyptian Desert Elders and Monastic Communities, - *The Cell: Meeting God and Ourselves, - *Patience: Learning Not to Run from God or Authentic Human Life, - *Stillness and Silence: Being Present to God, Ourselves, and the World, - *Praxis: An Ascetic Vocation that Forms, Nourishes and Guards the Soul, - *Praxis and Labor: The Sanctification of Daily Life, - *Humility: Making Christ Tangible, - and *Two Deserts. - Also includes an introduction and a bibliography.</p><p><i>The Rev.

Of the making of books there is no end, as the Preacher, said, but to find grain among the chaff is a gift.Theresa Margaret, C.H.N. Hermit, Iconographer Llyn Peninsula, Wales <br><br>There is so much that resonates (and stirs my conscience) on every page, and so much that is relevant and helpful here and now in very practical terms, not only for solitaries like me, but also for anyone committed to God, and indeed anyone searching for commitment, for we all have the need for solitude in our spirit, whatever form of life we live. It is full of wisdom , not only that of the abbas and ammas, but your own. It is a book to savor and re-read. Indeed it is one of those rare books where a paragraph or even a sentence or phrase is enough for the time being.Theresa Margaret, C.H.N. Hermit, Iconographer Llyn Peninsula, Wales <br><br>Well written, inspiring, and provocative.

But how often is Malcolm X understood as a religious leader, a man profoundly affected by his relationship with Allah?</p> <p>During Malcolm's life and since, the press has focused on the Nation of Islam's rejection of integration, offering an extremely limited picture of its ideology and religious philosophy. Mainstream media have ignored the religious foundation at the heart of the Nation and failed to show it in light of other separatist religious movements. With the spirituality of cultic black Islam unexplored and the most controversial elements of the Nation exploited, its most famous member, Malcolm X, became one of the most misunderstood leaders in history. </p> <p>In <i>On the Side of My People</i>, Louis A. DeCaro, Jr. offers the first book length religious treatment of Malcolm X. Malcolm X was certainly a political man. Yet he was also a man of Allah, struggling with his salvation&#x2014;as concerned with redemption as with revolution.</p> <p>Drawing on a wide variety of sources, including extensive interviews with Malcolm's oldest brother, FBI surveillance documents, the black press, and tape-recorded speeches and interviews, DeCaro examines the charismatic leader from the standpoint of his two conversion experiences--to the Nation while he was in jail and to traditional Islam climaxing in his pilgrimage to Mecca. Examining Malcolm beyond his well-known years as spokesman for the Nation, <i>On the Side My People</i> explores Malcolm's early religious training and the influence of his Garveyite parents, his relationship with Elijah Muhammad, his often overlooked journey to Africa in 1959, and his life as a traditional Muslim after the 1964 pilgrimage. In his critical analysis of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, DeCaro provides insight into the motivation behind Malcolm's own story, offering a key to understanding how and why Malcolm portrayed his life in his own autobiography as told to Alex Haley. </p><p>Inspiring and necessary, <i>On the Side My People</i> presents readers with a Malcolm X few were privileged to know. By filling in the gaps of Malcolm's life, DeCaro paints a more complete portrait of one of the most powerful and relevant civil rights figures in American history.</p></p><p><p><strong>Louis A. Decaro, Jr.</strong>, is a graduate of Westminster Theological Seminary and New York University and author of <em>On the Side of My People: A Religious Life of Malcolm X</em>.</p>A book that will surely find its way onto every short list of indispensable sources for understanding the life and work of Malcolm X. The religious dimension of Malcolm X is rightly emphasized, and in this respect, the book is an important addition to James Cone's groundbreaking <i>Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America</i> (1991). But it is also important for the clarity with which it presents Malcolm's Garveyite roots and internationalist perspective, both factors that owe more to his family than to the Nation of Islam. Those roots help explain Malcolm's development toward Sunni orthodoxy in the context of his pan-African commitment. Attending to them should help correct the provincial interpretation to which Malcolm has so often been subjected--by both detractors and admirers. DeCaro carefully traces Malcolm's spiritual development from the Garveyite teaching of his parents and pluralist religious toleration of his mother through his involvement with the cultic and exclusive Nation of Islam to his full embrace of Orthodox Islam before, during, and after his pilgrimage to Mecca. The whole life, as DeCaro reads it, is one of Islam, a submission that is marked by continuous conversion. DeCaro's work is scholarly and thorough, but it is also accessible; it will deepen both the popular and scholarly appreciation of Malcolm X and his contribution to the unfinished work of human liberation. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Sanfords Guide to Brush-McCoy Pottery Book-2</h2><p>Beautiful hard Cover 9&#34; x 12&#34; reference guide with price guide. 80 pages, packed with full color photos, catalog sheets, and history. Since 1992, when the Sanfords Guide to Brush Mccoy Pottery Book 1 was published, more catalog sheets have become available and more pieces have surfaced. Hence, there was a need for a second book. In 1996, the Sanfords published this second book. Sanfords Guide to Brush-McCoy Pottery, Book 2, features many more catalog sheets and pieces of pottery manufactured by the Brush-McCoy Pottery Company. With expanded coverage of the blue and white ware, along with highlights from the 1930&#39;s and later, the book is a must for any Brush-McCoy collector. Lines included are Jardinieres and Pedestals, Umbrella stands, Jetwood, Jewel, Egypta, Onyx, Florastone, Krackle-Kraft, Colonial Mat, Stone Art Pottery Lines, Kolorkraft, Art Vellum, Cleo, Fancy Vases, Art pottery, Novelities and Novelty planters, Whitestone Bristol Glazed Ware, Stoneware, Nurock, Kitchenware, Rockcraft, Frogs and Turtles, Garder pottery, and Later Pottery Lines. An alphabetical index is included for easy location. Book 2 also has a pull out price guide for easy and accurate valuation. Together Book 1 and Book 2, make the most complete guide to the pottery manufactured by the Brush- McCoy Pottery Company.</p><p>As Martha and I found pieces of pottery that were not in our book (Book 1), we photographed and documented them. By the time we were ready to reprint our book, we had eighty pages of additional information and photographs. Thus was born Book 2.Designed as a companion to their first work on Brush-McCoy, this book gives collectors additional insights into this Ohio pottery. In Book 2, the Sanfords present a picture price guide that smoothly combines color photographs with reproduced catalog pages. <p>The book focuses on pieces of pottery not pictured in Book 1 and additional catalog pages. A section on blue-and-white pottery is also featured. </p><p>Items are grouped according to type, such as jardinieres, as well as lines. Brief background information is provided; however, the authors defer to Book 1 for more in-depth text. </p><p>Values are contained in a loose supplement. The price ranges are based on the high and low estimates from a panel of dealers and collectors. </p><p>The only drawback here is the small type size of the text and captions, which some people may find difficult to read. Otherwise, this book serves as a fine companion to the first one. -- <i>Antique Trader</i><br><br>The first piece of pottery I ever bought was a jardiniere. I liked the colors. And being a collector by nature if not by experience at that point, I went on to buy others. As long as the colors pleased me. When I bought the Huxfords reprinting of Brush-McCoy catalogs (now out of print), I was intrigued to find that so many of the pieces I had been attracted to were made by that company. So I was delighted when the Sanfords first book on Brush-McCoy was published, and I am delighted again. </p><p>This second book has been occasioned by the availability of additional catalog sheets and the surfacing of new items to photograph and share with readers. The format is the same as the first book chronological by lines, with catalog sheets reproduced in color alongside photos of some of the items. The photos are large and well shot, attractively laid out (though sometimes figuring out which caption goes with which photo can be confusing), and the catalog sheets are well reproduced. </p><p>This new book covers lines not included in the first book, as well as more coverage of the early blue and white ware, and lines from the 30s through the 60s, especially figural planters. This is useful given the confusion between products of Brush-McCoy, American Bisque, Shawnee and other potteries. Another highlight are the garden ornaments, which have been selling well for years but are still considered a sleeper. There is also kitchenware, stoneware, wonderful vases, jardinieres and pedestals and umbrella stands, and novelties of various sorts. One of the discoveries of this book is the solid-color pastel Coronado Art Pottery line of novelties made for the Carson Crockery Company in Denver. Theres a lot of pottery in these pages. </p><p>There is a useful index and cross-references to the first book. I recommend both books. -- <i>Harvey Duke, The Daze</i></p></p><h2>German Slanguage: A Fun Visual Guide to German Terms and Phrases (English and German Edition)</h2><p><p>Learn simple German faster than you can say gesundheit!</p> <p>With this fun visual guide, just follow the illustrated prompts and read the English words out loud.

Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature&#x2014;predicted by some to be the future of the written word&#x2014;languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of "Riding the Bullet" and "The Plant."<br> <br> Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games&#x2014;those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme&#x2014;can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like "e-books"? The editors of <i>First Person</i> have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between "story" and "game," as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment.<br> <br> This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from "Cyberdrama" to "Ludology" (the study of games), to "The Pixel/The Line" to "Beyond Chat." The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a <i>First Person</i> web site (created in conjunction with the online journal <i>Electronic Book Review</i>).</p><p>Noah Wardrip-Fruin is Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He is the coeditor of four collections published by the MIT Press: with Nick Montfort, <i>The New Media Reader</i> (2003); with Pat Harrigan, <i>First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game</i> (2003), <i>Second Person: Role-Playing and Story in Games and Playable Media</i> (2007), and <i>Third Person: Authoring and Exploring Vast Narratives</i> (2009). He is the author of <i>Expressive Processing,</i> published by the MIT Press in 2009."You have entered the rotunda of a gleaming, new conference center. Above you hangs a banner: 'Welcome to First Person.' In front of you, you see doors leading into separate conference rooms, each of which is marked with a sign in large, Futura Bold letters: 'Cyberdrama,' 'Ludology,' 'Simulation,' 'Hypertext and Interactives,' and so on. You soon discover that every room in this virtual conference called First Person is filled with informed discussion and lively controversy from major figures in the emerging field of Game Studies. Some are arguing that digital games (as the heirs of the novel and of film) constitute the next great arena for storytelling; others respond that games are not narratives at all and require a different theoretical framework and a new discipline. Still others are describing their own exciting contributions to interactive fiction, poetry, or visual/verbal art. By the time you return from this virtual tour of the world of Game Studies, you realize that all of these rooms (and all these topics) are connected in an intricate and compelling architecture of ideas. You begin to understand the rich possibilities that computer games offer . . . as drama, narrative, and simulation. You come to appreciate the great theoretical task that lies before us in exploring both the formal properties and the cultural significance of computer games."<br> &#x2014;<b>Jay David Bolter</b>, Wesley Professor of New Media, Georgia Institute of Technology<br><br>"<i>First Person</i> makes an invaluable contribution to the current discussion surrounding new media narratives, computer games, and the performative ties that bind them.

Authentic, intimate, and intense, <i>Stay Here with Me</i> is about growing up and leaving home and about the acts of rebellion that free the body even as they bind the soul to a place forever.<br></p><p><i>Stay Here with Me</i> is really a fictional "memoir" of Robert Olmstead's life. Though the main facts are true--he grew up on a farm, went to college at 19, and performed a variety of odd jobs in between cross-country motorcycle adventures--Olmstead is gifted in the art of embroidering facts. He describes in amusing detail how he and two other farm helpers lifted a ton stone, by hand, and boasts that he was so adjusted to natural time on the farm, he didn't learn to read a clock until he was 14. Readers will want to believe the brilliant and tender rendering of a youthful romance, though the young lady in question just might object to Olmstead's recollection of it.Hailed as one of the most original voices in contemporary fiction by Raymond Carver, Lorrie Moore, and Tobias Wolff, Robert Olmstead is the author of three novels, a memoir, and a collection of stories. He has been a logger, a farmer, and a teacher, among other professions. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, he lives in Ohio. <br></p><h2>Moon Yosemite, Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Moon Travel Guides: Find Your Adventure<br><br>Explore granite domes, thundering waterfalls, and towering trees: <i>Moon Yosemite, Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon</i> reveals the best of these stunning parks.

Like many first-time visitors, she was immediately inspired by the Valley's sheer granite walls and shimmering waterfalls. Parking her car at the first trailhead she saw, she set off on the Four-Mile Trail. Carrying nothing but a water bottle, she intended to hike only a short distance but was so wowed by the scenery that she kept on walking. Two hours later she found herself at Glacier Point, considered by many to be the grandest viewpoint in the West. Scanning the scene, she noticed tourists dressed in everything from high heels to a nun's habit, and realized that she could have driven to Glacier Point instead of walking.

Or it could be that most of us, especially the high school teacher variety, are just weird as shit.<br><br>Only the slightly insane would choose a career teaching teenagers. I can just see my best girlfriend Suzanna's face screw up and the involuntary shudder move down her spine as I relate the latest trials and tribulations of the high school English classroom.<br><br>"God, Sha, they're so...so...<em>hormone filled. </em>Eew!"<br><br>Suzanna is a typical college professor snob, but I love her anyway. She just doesn't appreciate the many and varied opportunities for humorous interludes that teenagers provide on a daily basis.<br><br>Jean Valjean's dynamic tenor interrupted my musings, bringing me back to Oklahoma I&#x2013;44 East and June 1.<br><br>"Yep, this is it&#x2014;the life of a high school English teacher with a sense of humor. Doomed to having no money but plenty of comedic fodder. Oh, crap, there's my exit!"<br><br>Luckily my little Mustang could take the hard, fast right onto US&#x2013;412. The sign said Locust Grove 22 miles. I drove half with my knee and half with my hand while I fumbled to unfold the auction flyer that held my written directions. Somewhere about midway between Locust Grove (what an awful name for a town) and Siloam Springs there should be a big sign that pointed to a side road till another sign, another side road, and so forth, until I came to the Unique Estate Auction&#x2014; Unusual Items&#x2014;All Offers Considered&#x2014;All Must Go.<br><br>"Well, I certainly like weird old stuff. And I really like weird old cheap stuff."<br><br>My students say my classroom is like a bizarre time warp. My walls and cabinets are filled with everything from prints by Waterhouse to posters of Mighty Mouse and hanging <em>Star Trek Enterprise </em>models, along with an almost scary number of wind chimes (they're good chi).<br><br>And that's just my classroom. They should see my condo. Guess they really wouldn't be surprised. Except at home I'm a neat freak. My classroom is always in a perpetual state of disarray. I can't seem to find anything if everything is found. Whatever the hell that means.<br><br>"I've got to stop cussing!" Saying it out loud would, hopefully, reinforce the idea. Kind of a twist on the Pavlov's dog theory. I keep saying it; it will begin to happen.<br><br>"I can't take you today, Javert." Flick! Off went <em>Les Mis�rables. </em>On goes the jazz station out of Tulsa. It's cool that I could pick it up way out in the boonies.<br><br>The sign read Locust Grove City Limits. So I slowed down, blinked, and the town was gone. Well, maybe it was nominally bigger than a blink. And I stayed slowed down. Time to stop and smell the green of Green Country. Oklahoma in early summer is an amazing display of color and texture. I went to college at the University of Illinois, and it always annoyed me that people talked about Oklahoma like it was a red dust bowl. Or some black-and-white scene of misery from <em>The Grapes of Wrath. </em>When I tried to tell the college gang that Oklahoma was really known as "Green Country" they would scoff and look at me as if they thought I'd eaten too many tumbleweeds or punched too many cows.<br><br>I passed through the tiny town of Leach (another unfortunate name) and topped a rise in the road. Oklahoma stretched before me, suddenly looking untamed in its beauty. I like to imagine a time when these roads were just paths, and civilization hadn't been so sure of itself. It must have been exciting to be alive then&#x2014; not exciting like facing the principal after he has just heard from a parent who is upset about me calling Guinevere a slut&#x2014;but exciting in a rugged, perhaps-we-won't-bathe-or-brush-our-teeth and we-kill-our-own-food-and-tote-our-own-water kind of way. Ugh. On second thought... It's delicious to dream about the days of cowboys or knights or dragons, and I will admit to an obsession with poets of the Romantic era and literature set, well, way back when (technical English teacher term). But reality reminds me that in actuality they did without penicillin and Crest. As my kids would say, "What's up with that?"<br><br>"There it is! Turnoff number one, as in a road sign, not to be confused with the blind date who comes to your door in navy blue double-knit trousers and a receding hairline."<br><br>UNIQUE ESTATE AUCTION AHEAD and an arrow, which pointed down a side road to my left.<br><br>This road was much less traveled (poetic pun intended). Kind of a sorry little two-laner with potholes and deep gravel shoulders. But it twisted and rolled in a pretty way and "To Grandmother's house we go" hummed through my mind. I tried in vain to remember the rest of the song for the next several miles.<br><br>UNIQUE ESTATE AUCTION AHEAD and another arrow. Another side-side road. This one more gravel, less two lane, than the other. Well, maybe the out-of-the-wayness of the estate would serve to dissuade the antique dealers, whom I considered the bane of every broke auction-goer. The jazz station faded out, which was actually fine because the Grandmother's House song had also faded from my internal radio&#x2014; and been replaced with the theme to <em>The Beverly Hillbillies </em>(these words I did remember all of, which I found vaguely disturbing).<br><br>Speaking of hillbillies, I hadn't seen many houses. Hmmm...maybe the "estate" was really an old ranch house, smack in the middle of what used to be a real ranch owned by some Bonanzaesque rich folks. Now they've all died off and the land would be subdivided into neat little housing divisions so upper-middle-class folks could commute to...well, wherever. I call that job security for me. Upper-middle-class folks always have the prerequisite 2.5 kids, plus an additional 1.5 kid (from a previous marriage). And those kids gotta pass English to graduate from high school. God bless America.<br><br>Over a crook and a rise in the "road" loomed what I had been imagining as an old ranch house. "Holy shit! It's the House of Usher!" (Summer was definitely not the time to work on the cussing thing.) I slowed. Yep&#x2014;there was another sign: UNIQUE ESTATE AUCTION, planted next to the gravel trail leading to the estate. A few cars, but mostly trucks (it <em>is </em>Oklahoma) were parked on what at one time was obviously a beautifully maintained front... I don't know... what the hell do you call something like that...it stretched on and on...yard seemed too simple a word. Grounds. That sounded better. Lots of grass. The drive was lined with <em>big </em>trees, as in <em>Gone with the Wind, </em>minus the weeping moss.<br><br>I realized I was gawking because an old guy dressed in black slacks and a high-necked white cotton shirt was waving me in with one of those handheld orange flashlight things, and his face had an irritated "stop gawking and drive, lady" look on it. As I pulled up next to him, he motioned for me to roll my window down.<br><br>"Afternoon, miss." He bent slightly at the waist and peered into my window. A fetid rush of air brought his words into my air-conditioned interior and killed my initial joy at being called "miss," which is definitely younger sounding than "ma'am." He was taller than I first thought, and his face was heavily lined, as if he had worked outside in the elements most of his life, but his complexion was a sickly sallow color.<br><br>Good God! It was the daddy from <em>Children of the Corn.</em><br><br>"Afternoon. Sure is warm today." I tried to be pleasant.<br><br>"Yes, miss." Ugh&#x2014;that <em>smell </em>again. "Please pull forward onto The Green. The auction will begin promptly at two."<br><br>"Uh, thanks." I tried to smile as I rolled the window up and moved to follow his pointed directions. What was that smell? Like something dead. Well, he was awfully pale; perhaps he wasn't well. That would account for the smell and the fact that he was wearing long sleeves in June, and I was a seriously hateful bitch to call the poor old guy <em>Children of the Corn's </em>daddy. And the front yard is called The Green. Learn something new every day! I said to myself with a grimace. Clich�s are the bane of educated mankind.<br><br>Before I turned off the car, I took my required several minutes (a man once told me he could always tell how attractive a woman was by how long it took her to get out of a car&#x2014; I try to take a longgg time) to reapply my lipstick. I also took a minute to scope out the house. Scratch that&#x2014;mansion.<br><br>My first impression held. This place seriously conjured images of Poe and Hawthorne. It was humongous, in a sprawling, Victorian-type of way. I'm usually drawn to unusual old homes, but not so with this one. I tipped my sunglasses down my nose to get a better view. It looked odd. It took a moment to figure out why, then it hit me&#x2014;it looked as if it had been built in several different parts. The basic building was roughly a huge square, but added on to this square were two different porches, one rectangular with steps leading up to the entrance in a grandiose, sweeping manner. Not twenty feet down from the first porch was a second, rounded gazebo-like structure just, well, stuck on to the front of the building, complete with latticework and gnarly-looking roses. A large turret room was attached to one side of the building, like a cancerous growth, and a slope-roofed wing emerged from the opposite end of the structure. The whole thing was painted an awful shade of gray, and it was cracked and crinkled, like an old smoker's skin.<br><br>"There should really be some <em>unique </em>items to be had here." Muttering to myself, I got ready to tear my eyes away from Usher's abode when a shiver tickled down my spine. A thick cloud passed in front of the sun and the "walking on my grave" feeling hit me like a bad dream. <em>Is it late? It seems to me that the light darkens. </em>My English teacher mind plucked the quote from <em>Medea. </em>Greek tragedy, replete with revenge, betrayal and death. Seemed, in an inopportune way, appropriate.<br><br>"Jeesh, get a grip, Parker!" Ridiculous&#x2014;I needed to shake out of my gruesome mode, and get into my junk-shopping mode.<br><br>Oklahoma heat was waiting to embrace me with its humid arms as I stepped out of the car and clicked the lock on my keypad. Set up around the side of the house was a large table with a line of assorted auction-goers milling about it. I figured that was the sign-in table and headed that way, keeping part of my attention on the various piles of "stuff" that began stretching from the side yard around and disappearing into the rear of the grounds. My palms were already all atingle at the thought of digging through those heaped boxes. But first the sign-in.<br><br>"Whew! I should've put this hunk of hair up in a ponytail!" I was making neighborly small talk with the matron in front of me in line.<br><br>"Yup." She fanned herself with one of the UNIQUE AUCTION flyers, and her eyes slid from my already frizzing and sweaty hair, down past my white silk tank top, which slid just over the waist of my very hip (and short) khaki Gap skirt, to my long (and very bare) legs. "Ugf." She made a sound like a hen expelling an egg, and I guessed that was the end of my attempt at neighborly conversation.<br><br>"This place sure looks like it should have some interesting stuff for sale." I valiantly tried a second attempt at conversing, this time with the receding hairline behind me.<br><br>"Yes, I couldn't agree more." The hairline fidgeted, blinking sweat out of his eyes. "I heard that they will be auctioning several pieces of Depression Era glass, and just knew I had to make the trek. I find American glasswork fascinating, don't you?" By this time his squinty little eyes had found my cleavage, and it was obvious that glass wasn't all he found fascinating.<br><br>"Mmm, hmm, glass is cool." I stepped forward. It was the matron's turn to get her ticket, but she was so busy watching the hairline watch me that she could hardly give the registrar her info.<br><br>"Actually," he leaned way into my Personal Space, "I'm in the middle of editing a wonderfully informative coffee table book on the origins of Depression Era art and how to distinguish the difference between authentic pieces and facsimiles."<br><br>"Oh, that's, um, nice." He was still in my Personal Space and I tried inching forward, obviously crowding the matron, who was still standing in line pinning her auction number to her Depression Era bosom.<br><br>"I would be happy to offer you my expertise if you find any pieces you are interested in bidding on. I would hate to see such a <em>lovely </em>young lady taken advantage of...." His voice cracked and he nervously dabbed the sweat off his upper lip with a folded handkerchief. I noticed the yellowed stains shadowing his pits. Guess that button-down oxford was just a little too warm for this trek.<br><br>"I'll be sure to let you know if I need you." My turn, thank God.<br><br>"Name, please." I could sense hairline's ears growing to catch the answer.<br><br>"Shannon Parker."<br><br>"Ms. Parker, your number is 074. Please fill out your address next to the 074 slot. Keep the number with you at all times, the auctioneer will refer to your number if you purchase an item. When you have made all your purchases, simply give the cashier your number and she will present you with your bill."<br><br></p><h2>Roman Warfare (Smithsonian History of Warfare)</h2><p><p>The Roman Army was the most advanced professional fighting force the world had ever seen.

But how to do that? So much has changed in the way we feed, vaccinate, train, and live with our dogs from even a decade ago.<br><br>In an adventure that echoes <i>The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma</i> with a canine spin, Kerasote tackles all those subjects, questioning our conventional wisdom and emerging with vital new information that will surprise even the most knowledgeable dog lovers. Can a purebred be as healthy as a mixed-breed? How many vaccines are too many? Should we rethink spaying and neutering? Is raw food really healthier than kibble, and should your dog be chewing more bones? Traveling the world and interviewing breeders, veterinarians, and leaders of the animal-welfare movement, Kerasote pulls together the latest research to help us rethink the everyday choices we make for our companions.

He now lives in New York City, where he works as a printmaker, painter, and illustrator. He says of OLD COYOTE, "My goal for the images was to capture the essence of the words while leaving enough room for the viewer's imagination to roam." This is Max Grafe's first full-color picture book.Grade 1-3&#x2013;Old Coyote is nearing the end of his days. As he walks familiar paths, he remembers the wide open spaces before the city crept toward his home. He recalls a time when "his howl was so loud that even the earthworms up on the mountain could hear it." He can't run anymore, so he walks, even though his bones ache. He pauses for a rest beneath the old saguaro cactus and continues toward home, greeting Father Sun on his way. Finally, he arrives at his den where he and Mrs. Coyote share some tender moments. With the light from the full moon to guide him, Old Coyote heads out toward a gathering spot where he says good-bye to his animal friends. Climbing slowly to the top of a mountain, he lies down and falls asleep. All the while he is dreaming of golden days gone by, until at last he "[dreams] his way into a whole new world." This gentle and sensitive story is delivered in just the right respectful manner without being maudlin. Grafe's mixed-media illustrations were done in muted shades of brown and blue. The drawings are somewhat impressionistic, mimicking what might be seen by Old Coyote's aging eyes. A comforting tale that is suitable for helping to explain death to young children.<i>&#x2013;Roxanne Burg, Orange County Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So argues Alexander Moffat in the introduction to his fascinating and very easy to read survey of Scotland&#39;s environment and the people who affected it from the end of the Ice Age to AD 900 when the term `Alba&#39; was created. The study clearly guides us through the formation of Scotland&#39;s dramatic landscape and the arrival of the first hunter-gatherer-fisher settlers, tempted by the warming climate. Moffat presents the archaeological evidence for the first buildings, boats, and artefacts but he also looks beneath the surface to consider how human needs, sensibilities and beliefs shaped these remains, such as the layout of a house and the construction of the earliest stone monuments in Britain. Throughout, side panels present Moffat&#39;s reflections and digressions on a whole range of topics, such as examples of modern echoes of ancient behaviour, catastrophes, the age of the earth, Himalayan prawns, the creation of a perfect henge circle and Native Americans. This is a good book that cannot fail to convey to the general reader the author&#39;s expert enthusiasm for Scotland&#39;s past.</p><p><i>Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History</i> delves deep into the little-known world of the Picts, Scots, and others who lived before written records. It is a far-ranging book, jumping back and forth from a discussion of an ice age 24,000 years ago to a sidebar on the turn-of-the-century Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. Scotland itself is the only connection between passages on the disparate topics of geology, ancient and modern history, archeology, biology, and anthropology. <i>Before Scotland</i> resists the current fashion in nonfiction to turn history into narrative. It generally reads like a graduate-level textbook, with a touch of bone-dry humor thrown in for good measure. In a typical reference-laden passage, the author describes a foreign name for Scotland, writing, "Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Tacitus and Ptolemy all wrote of <i>Caledonia</i>, and the name has shown considerable staying power. Not only has it survived in place-names like Dunkeld, the nearby mountains of Schiehallion and elsewhere, it is also frequently used in the brands of commercial companies as a pungent and meaningful alternative to 'Scotland' or 'Scottish.' And its poetic atmosphere is often found in popular music and poetry. Exiles appear to be homesick more readily for Caledonia." Occasionally witty and genuinely informative, <i>Before Scotland</i> will greatly interest historians, linguists, and anyone curious about how the natural world has evolved in Scotland through the centuries. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i><b>Alistair Moffat</b> is a writer and television producer and announcer.

The answer is Simon Schama's <i>A History of Britain</i>, the first volume of which accompanies the BBC-History Channel series of the same name. In a beautifully written and thoughtfully crafted book, studded with striking portraits, pictures, and maps, Schama, the bestselling author of books on European cultural history such as <i>The Embarrassment of Riches</i> and <i>Citizens</i>, as well as 1999's <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i>, has managed to be both conventional and provocative.<p> He tells the official version of Britain's island story--from Roman Britain, through the Norman conquest, the struggles of the Henrys and Richards with their barons and clerics, Edward I and the subjugation of Wales, King Death (the plague), and on to the Henrician reformation, before closing with the remarkable reign of the virgin queen, Elizabeth I. But, while sticking to a script familiar to anyone who sat up and listened in history lessons at school, Schama brings it all alive, with memorable prose--Simon de Montfort's rebel parliament is described as inaugurating the "union between patriotism and insubordination"; with Henry VIII, Schama says, "you could practically smell the testosterone." And with fine sensitivity, too, particularly on the symbolism of buildings, memorials, language, and ceremonies, and on the complex relations between England and her Celtic and Catholic neighbors. If history must have gloss, then let it be written and presented like this. <i>--Miles Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Simon Schama has taught history at Cambridge, Oxford, and Harvard universities.

Reprint.</p><p>Getting to follow big, bad Byzantine Belisarius around the alt-history battlefield--courtesy of Eric Flint and David Drake--comes in a close second to having your own personal unit of cataphracts. (Although, of course, those cataphracts <i>would</i> be nice to have in traffic.) Following on the heels of <i>Destiny's Shield</i>, the fourth installment in this popular series follows the superhuman general as he harries Malwa troops in the mountains leading into Mesopotamia. He's still got the across-time assistance of the crystal Aide to help him deal with the threat, augmenting his senses and keeping him briefed on the tactics of everyone from Wellington to Turenne. But Link, the Supreme Commander of the Universe, still calls the shots for the evil empire, and Belisarius has to double-time to keep up (especially facing such shrewd field commanders as Damodara).<p> <i>Fortune's Stroke</i> downshifts the series a notch in terms of sheer Belisarius-meted carnage, because Damodara's Ye-tai barbarians and Rajput cavalry aren't the only show in town. Flint and Drake spend a good deal of time with other characters in the series in other locales, like Kungas and Irene in south India and Antonina in Axum (for a start). But this investment will surely pay off as the series continues, as Belisarius and his cohort close in on the Malwa for good. (And if you're new to the battle, start with <i>An Oblique Approach</i>, the first title in the series.) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>This exuberant romp of an alternate-history novel is the fourth volume of a series (Destiny's Shield, etc.) in which two contending super-beings from the far future try to determine humanity's fate through changing the 6th century A.D. The villain, Link, uses the Indian Malwa Empire as his tool; the benefactor, Aide, chooses the Byzantine Empire and particularly the famous Count Belisarius, its most formidable general. Belisarius's formidable wife, Antonina, plays matchmaker for the emperor of Ethiopia, thus giving the forces of good a fighting navy in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. The delightful diplomatic noblewoman Irene Macrembolitissa also plays matchmaker, securing the marriage of the Maratha leader Ragunath Rao to his beloved Princess Shakuntala (a South Asian Princess Leia figure). Finally, Belisarius himself brings the Malwans' invasion of Persia to an end. However, Link has managed to find another human host and is as ruthless as ever, while Aide has developed a raunchy sense of humor from too much association with biological humans. Readers shouldn't take all this too seriously (and those new to the series would do well to read the earlier volumes before tackling this one), but should sit back and chortle while admiring the authors' alternate-technological ingenuity.

But when a rival store opens, tensions begin to bubble...As she sits in her nearly empty store on Groundhog Day, Hannah can only hope that spring is just around the corner - and that the popularity of the new Magnolia Blossom Bakery is just a passing fad. The southern hospitality of Lake Eden&#39;s two Georgia transplants, Shawna Lee and Vanessa Quinn, is grating on Hannah&#39;s nerves - and cutting into her profits. At least Hannah has her business partner Lisa&#39;s wedding to look forward to. She&#39;s turned one of Lisa&#39;s favorite childhood treats into a spectacular Wedding Cookie Cake. And Lisa&#39;s aunt will be bringing her famous Peach Cobbler to the reception. But Hannah starts to steam when she finds out that Shawna Lee has been invited - and is bringing her own Peach Cobbler. Hannah doesn&#39;t like having the Georgia Peach in the mix, especially when both Shawna Lee and Hannah&#39;s sometime-boyfriend, Detective Mike Kingston, are no-shows to the wedding. Hannah has suspected that Mike is interested in more than Shawna Lee&#39;s baking abilities. So when she sees lights on at the Magnolia Blossom Bakery after the reception, she investigates - and finds Shawna Lee shot to death. Everyone in town knew the Cookie Jar was losing business to the Magnolia Bakery - a fact that puts Hannah at the top of the initial list of suspects. But with a little help from her friends, Hannah&#39;s determined to prove that she wasn&#39;t the only one who had an axe to grind with the Quinn sisters. Somebody wasn&#39;t fooled by the Georgia Peaches and their sweet-as-pie act - and now it&#39;s up to Hannah to track down whoever had the right ingredients to whip up a murder...</p><p><b>JOANNE FLUKE</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Hannah Swensen mysteries, which include <i>Double Fudge Brownie Murder, Blackberry Pie Murder</i>, <i>Cinnamon Roll Murder</i>, and the book that started it all, <i>Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder.</i> That first installment in the series premiered as <i>Murder, She Baked:&nbsp;A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery</i> on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries Channel.

Peering 'round the corner of the bullet-pocked market front, he was glad not for the first time that he had violated orders in carrying his personal weapon in the "blood box" armored ambulance. "Presence" was fine and good when all you wanted to do was impress the locals. It was downright stupid when those same people wanted to nail your hide to the wall like a plaster duck.The American-made M113 "Bucket" continued burning a block and a half down the littered street, drawing a crowd of African celebrants. Few in the mob were armed, but some realized that the white soldiers who escaped from the light armored vehicle must be on foot. One Australian had not. His body was dragged away from the APC and some teenagers began stripping the corpse."They nailed Joji all right," Martin called to his wounded driver, two meters behind him.Lance Corporal James Frasier looked up from his sitting position. "What about Dimitri?""Never bleeding got out, I reckon." Martin shook his head, pondering the geographic irony. What were the odds that a Fijian and a Russian would emigrate to Australia only to die in Chad?<i>It's Mogadishu all over</i>, Martin thought. <i>Arsehole politicians keep sending Diggers as peacekeepers, then complain when we enforce the bloody peace</i>. He looked around, seeking a hiding spot. Besides his carbine, he was most grateful for the Wagtail radio that the wounded driver dragged in his left hand. The man's right hand was blistered and raw from detonation of the RPG, as was his right leg. Martin glanced down at his friend. "Jamie, how ya going?""I'm about buggered, Derro," Frasier croaked. He was hurt, winded, and scared. The fact that he addressed a superior by his nickname was an Aussie trait.Martin ignored the response. "You got anybody yet?"Frasier hefted the backpack radio. "Nothing yet. I've tried the allocated frequencies but this kit is only good for about eight kilometers. Only thing left is the high setting, but it'll use more juice.""Well, give 'em a hoy. Every bleeding sot in this bleeding pesthole must know where we are by now."As Frasier switched channels, Martin realized that the Australians had been seen. Several armed men motioned in their direction from up the street and began jogging toward the market. Martin looked around, confirming that he was out of the mob's line of sight. Sure enough, a woman waved a cloth from the second floor of a building behind him. She was saying something in Arabic, pointing to him and shouting to make herself heard.<i>Bloody bitch</i>. Martin swung his Steyr to his shoulder, put the "death doughnut" aiming circle on the black woman's torso, and took up some of the slack in the single-stage trigger. She saw the 5.56 mm muzzle raising toward her and ducked inside, not knowing if the white man had intended to shoot.Neither did Martin.Frasier got his attention. "I can't get through, mate. It's jammed with calls. Apparently the army and a rebel faction are fighting all over the city."Martin safed his F88, slung it again, and leaned down. He raised Frasier to standing and helped him limp down the dirty street, forcing his way through pedestrians with a wave of the Steyr. Along the way, Martin's U.N. cap slid off his head but he was glad to be rid of the baby blue "target marker.""In there!" Frasier called."What?"Frasier did not reply. He just pointed inside an office with a sign "<i>Importons et Exportons</i>." Without asking why, Martin helped his friend through the door and shut it behind them.Frasier reached for the telephone. "Please, Lord, let it work. I frigging <i>promise</i> I'll go see the damned God both-erer on Sunday." He lifted the receiver and grinned through the smoke on his face. "I've got a dial tone! What number should I ring?""Hell's toes, I don't know. Try ..."A middle-aged Arab emerged from the rear of the office. He stopped dead in his tracks, assessed the uniformed strangers, and smiled. "Sir, I can help?" He spoke English with a French accent."Too bloody right, mate." Frasier extended the phone.Martin responded more formally. "Yes, sir. We sure would appreciate any help. We need to contact our lot at the United Nations compound.""Ah, <i>oui</i>." The dignified businessman bowed slightly, raising a hand to the tie he wore. He accepted the receiver from Frasier, dialed a number, and spoke alternately in French, Arabic, and English. Less than two minutes later he passed the phone back. "This is U.N., ah, house. Person talks not good English. Mostly French."<i>Bloody ethnics</i>. Martin nodded his thanks. "Could you please tell him where we are? Ask if we can speak to anybody in the military advisory group." He tried to conjure the phrase: something like <i>Groupe advisory militaire</i>.Mr. Haroun, as he introduced himself, was helpful and patient. Perhaps uncharitably, Martin was wondering what the businessman would expect in return for his assistance when a crowd of blacks rounded the corner half a block away. The composition was made for trouble: young, male, and angry.Martin reached for Frasier and helped him toward the rear of the office. Mr. Haroun, apparently unflappable, remained standing at the desk, phone to his ear, awaiting more response from the functionary in N'Djamena.Moments later the leading elements of the crowd reached the debris-littered street in front of the storefront. One of the young men leaned down and picked up an object. To Haroun it appeared as a colored rag. Apparently it meant something to the angry rioters.Then he knew.He slammed down the phone and paced to the rear of the store. Gesturing animatedly, he made shooing motions. "<i>Allez, allez!</i> You go! Now!"Frasier looked up, confused. "What's he ...""Oh, my God." It emerged as a low, fervent curse. Martin was peering around the hallway corner, fifteen meters to the front door. He turned back to his friend. "The bastards found my hat. We gotta be off like a bride's nightie."Crashing glass and rising voices echoed through the building. The front rank of rioters reached the outer office, smashing furniture and fixtures. Martin turned his head. "Mr. Haroun, see to him, will you?""Derro! C'mon, mate!""Can't do it, Jamie. They'll catch us sure. You chuff off!"With that, Martin turned back toward the hallway, already filling with men vocally intent on homicide. There were few firearms but several machetes. Martin looked over the top of his optical sight and began shooting.Copyright � 2007 by Harold Coyle</p><h2>A Prize for Princes</h2><p>Serialized in All Story magazine, A Prize for Princes now appears in book form for the first time. The beautiful, evil and deadly Aline is rescued from marauding Turks by a wealthy American who becomes captivated by her. His wealth enables her to meet men of power, upon whom she plys her sensual talents in intrigue and murder.</p><p>What we have here is that specialty genre: the literary curiosity. Certainly, any previously unpublished novel by the creator of the legendary Nero Wolfe will be of interest to fans, but Stout's name on the title page is all that recommends this potboiler. First serialized in <i>All Story</i> magazine--one can almost imagine the steamy cover with Vargas-like women and leering, bloodthirsty Turks--the tale stars a rich, brave American, Richard Stetton, who rescues the voluptuous Aline Solini from a convent during a Turkish uprising in an unnamed Balkan outpost. He falls madly in love; she exploits his puppylike devotion for her own evil purposes. Encountering intrigue at every turn, they scamper frantically about Asia, always one step ahead of Aline's vengeful ex-husband, Vasili Petrovich. No brief summary can begin to convey the strange twists that litter this plot; keep in mind, though, that the book was published as a serial, requiring Stout to create and resolve crises from the end of one installment to the start of the next. Buy the book for its curiosity value if you must, but don't be fooled about its quality. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>EARLY MORNING (Dinosaur Days)</h2><p>Little So-and-So hatches out of an egg and plays in the sun with the other dinosaurs.</p><p></p><h2>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl</h2><p>This book is an account of Anne Frank&#39;s life.</p><p></p><h2>The Fu Manchu Omnibus: Volume 3</h2><p>The Trail of Fu Manchu:The great fog of 1935.

Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power.

Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people.

Started by two twenty-year-old musicians, Merge is a lesson in how to make and market great music on a human scale.&nbsp; The fact that the company is prospering in a failing industry is something of a miracle. Yet two of their bands made the Billboard Top 10 list; more than 1 million copies of Arcade Fire's <i>Neon Bible</i> have been sold; Spoon has appeared on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and <i>The Tonight Show</i>; and the Magnetic Fields' <i>69 Love Songs</i> is a contemporary classic. <br><br>In celebration of their twentieth anniversary, founders Mac and Laura offer first-person accounts&#x2015;with the help of their colleagues and Merge artists&#x2015;of their work, their lives, and the culture of making music. <i>Our Noise</i> also tells the behind-the-scenes stories of Arcade Fire, Spoon, the Magnetic Fields, Superchunk, Lambchop, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Butterglory. Hundreds of personal photos of the bands, along with album cover art, concert posters, and other memorabilia are included.<br></p><p>Laura Ballance plays bass in Superchunk and formed with Mac the Merge Records label. She lives in Durham with her husband and daughter.<br><br><br>John Cook is a reporter for Gawker Media and has worked for Radar magazine and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. <br><br>Mac McCaughan plays in Superchunk and Portastatic (guitar and vocals), and founded, with Laura Ballance, the Merge Records label in 1989. He lives in Chapel Hill with his wife and children.<br>Despite the high-profile name recognition of bands like REM and Nirvana, indie rock was hardly known by mainstream music listeners. That&#39;s not surprising given the deliberately obscure nature of the genre, which is epitomized by the title of this book--co-authored by Merge Records founders McCaughan and Ballance. Located in the college town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Merge embraced the do-it-yourself ethic. Founded on handshake agreements and geeky ideals, the label maintained integrity in the face of an industry that doesn&#39;t have any. Narrator Ray Porter gets the irony to be found in the story. He takes the tone of an insider with his droll delivery as he describes the politics of the underground movement and the almost-uptight preoccupations of its participants, which make the party-down ethic of the previous generation&#39;s rockers seem quaint.

Wagner's music drama, as he called it, aimed at a union of poetry, drama, music, and stagecraft.&nbsp;In a rare book-length study, the composer discusses the enhancement of dramas by operatic treatment and the subjects that make the best dramas. The expected Wagnerian voltage is here: in his thinking about myths such as Oedipus, his theories about operatic goals and musical possibilities, his contempt for musical politics, his exaltation of feeling and fantasy, his reflections about genius, and his recasting of Schopenhauer.&nbsp;This edition includes the full text of volume 2 of William Ashton Ellis's 1893 translation commissioned by the London Wagner Society.</p><p></p><h2>Chairing an Academic Department</h2><p>"Academic leaders may be in the least studied and most misunderstood management position in the world," authors Gmelch and Miskin state. Although chairs come to the position for varied reasons, few come with any specific leadership training. Once in the position, they are critiqued, judged, and evaluated by both their faculty and administrators&#x2014;groups which frequently have conflicting criteria.<p> </p><p>Based upon their extensive study of the demands on and needs of chairs, the authors have distilled their findings into a practical and highly accessible volume to guide chairs in their growth. Despite the varied paths to the position, the authors state that all chairs find themselves in an environment distinct from their former facultly situation.</p><p> </p><p>One of the most dramatic changes is that chairs need the ability to switch from one task or situation to another very quickly, and must develop a facility for refocusing. As chairs, individuals assume four basic roles: faculty developer, manager, leader, and scholar. Because of these roles and the need to quickly refocus, Gmelch and Miskin advocate becoming a swivel chair. They state: "To balance their roles, chairs must learn to swivel without appearing dizzy, schizophrenic, or &#x2018;two-faced.&#x2019;"</p></p><p><p><b>Walter H.

But Judge Greg Mathis&#x2019;s own rise to success has been a trial by fire. In this truly candid memoir, his harrowing life on both sides of the law is revealed for the first time.<br><br>It starts in Detroit&#x2014;but far from the court where Greg would one day preside. Raised in the hell of the Herman Garden Projects, he grows to become a &#x201c;bad-ass, cool-dressing, do-anything gangsta.&#x201d; His father gone, his mother juggling two jobs, he falls in with the Errol Flynns&#x2014;&#x201c;funkified English gentlemen&#x201d; in three-piece suits and Borsalino hats, urban Robin Hoods who are truly stylish as they steal from everyone and give to themselves.<br><br>Considered bright but incorrigible, Greg is sent to stay in his middle-class cousin&#x2019;s mixed neighborhood, where he enlists the local white youth in wrongdoing. Even jail can&#x2019;t keep him from going bad again once he gets out. Then a threat to his beloved mother causes a shaken Greg to make a promise in a prayer to God: save my mother and I will straighten up.<br><br>To his and everyone else&#x2019;s surprise, he keeps his side of the bargain. Inspired by <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i>, working at McDonald&#x2019;s by day and attending classes by night, Greg pulls himself through high school and college and then law school, using in positive ways the innate intelligence that made him a master at crime. Soon he becomes the youngest judge in Michigan history, a District Court judge and, at last, undaunted by the odds and propelled by his personal story, a sought-after and highly paid TV star.<br><br>In its blunt, bold, and sometimes hair-raising honesty, <i>Inner City Miracle</i> is both a cautionary and an inspiring story, one sure to stun all those who come to Judge Mathis&#x2019;s TV courtroom every day.</p><p><b>Greg Mathis</b> is a former Detroit District Court judge, who stars in his own nationally syndicated television show. He lives in Detroit, Michigan.Dangling from a cold metal railing on the second level of Cobo Hall<br>Auditorium in downtown Detroit, I gaze down on thousands of unsuspecting<br>concertgoers who actually think that a performance by the<br>Average White Band is going to be the night's main event.<br><br>I say to myself, "It ain't about no damn band, you fools! If you<br>don't believe it, check this shit out." Grinning, I plummet to the concrete<br>nine feet below, which is fairly difficult to accomplish wearing<br>platform shoes with four-inch clear plastic heels.<br><br>The impact sends a jolt crunching through my thin body and I<br>stumble forward a few steps. I'd nearly dropped on the head of a<br>young black male usher who is now frantically sprinting toward an<br>exit. He's probably trying to alert the police, but it's a little late for<br>that. The boldest mass robbery in Detroit's history is under way, and<br>ain't nothin' he or anyone else can do to stop it!<br><br>The Errol Flynn gang is in the house and everybody at this concert<br>had better give up some jewelry or a wallet. Either that or get<br>cracked upside the head.<br><br>The year is 1977 and I'm in my element--lawlessness, chaos, and<br>bold action.<br><br>The same holds true for two hundred or so of my fellow Errol<br>Flynn gang members presently terrorizing the Cobo Hall Auditorium<br>all around me during a brief intermission between musical acts. Some<br>have actually vaulted onto the main stage while frightened and bewildered<br>concertgoers look on.<br><br>"Errol Flynn, Errol Flynn!" I gleefully holler at the top of my lungs,<br>matching the cadence of a handful of my homeboys who've commandeered<br>the microphone onstage and are rhythmically waving<br>their hands as they perform a popular 1970s dance called the Errol<br>Flynn.<br><br>Like our movie star namesake, we Flynns fancy ourselves to be<br>suave, swashbuckling, and rakish. And like the matinee idol whose<br>name we carry, if we're trying to bust a move and you get in our way,<br>we'll go upside your damn head.<br><br>Scanning a row full of Average White Band fans to my left, I see<br>what I've really come to Cobo Hall for. As I look down the row,<br>everyone on it is scowling mightily and shooting me expressions that<br>leave no doubt about their fear and disgust. They have no way of<br>knowing it, but the looks on their faces only heighten my tremendous<br>sense of exhilaration.<br><br>I lock eyes with a young, muscular brother who has his hands protectively<br>interlocked around his girlfriend's. His demeanor is defiant,<br>as though he's feeling his oats and primed to do something heroic and<br>macho.<br><br>I instinctually understand that if I break him down and force him<br>to bend to my will, the entire row will meekly follow his lead.<br><br>"Your wallet, please," I bellow, giving my victim the hardest, meanest<br>look I can muster. He shoots me a hard look right back, releases<br>his girlfriend's hands and turns in my direction, preparing for battle.<br>I expected that and slowly pull back the black pinstriped jacket of my<br>double-breasted suit so he can see my ace in the hole--a .38-caliber revolver<br>tucked in my waist.<br><br>Then with my eyes I silently dare him to continue his foolhardy<br>challenge. Some concertgoers have already been punched and kicked<br>for resisting, but things can get much, much worse. Reluctantly ceding<br>defeat, my muscular victim sullenly digs into his back pocket,<br>pulls out a brown leather wallet, and angrily flips it into the concrete<br>aisle near my feet.<br><br>As I quickly bend over to retrieve my booty, the air inside Cobo<br>Hall is filled with the noise of frantically chattering voices, the amplified<br>racket from my partners onstage and screams of fear and pain.<br>The sounds of bedlam and anarchy, sweet music to my ears.<br><br>"Thank you, sir. Gimme that watch, too."<br><br>The still-warm, expensive-looking silver timepiece is obediently<br>passed down the row. Once the tough guy has been broken, my other<br>victims quietly turn over their wallets, pocketbooks, bracelets, and<br>rings, glaring at me the entire time. Like I could give a damn.<br><br>I barely have time to shake down half of another row before I need<br>to make a hurried escape. Running as quickly as I can in my four-inch<br>heels, I become part of a mass exodus of youthful thugs wearing<br>platform-heeled shoes, double-breasted suits, Borsalino hats, wide-framed<br>white glasses with no lens.<br><br>Many of us also are toting expensive-looking umbrellas and walking<br>canes, which come in handy when looking dapper or when scything<br>through hordes of frenzied concertgoers.<br><br>As soon as I get outside Cobo Hall with the other Errol Flynns I<br>spy black-suited, helmeted riot police standing shoulder-to-shoulder<br>as they anxiously scan the exiting throng for lawbreakers.<br><br>They look stupid standing in the middle of the street with the<br>streetlights glinting off their dark helmets. What do they expect me to<br>do--walk up to them and surrender? Slowing down so that I'm moving<br>at the same pace as the escaping concertgoers, I place a look of<br>consternation and fear that matches theirs on my face. A wolf flowing<br>to freedom among the panicked sheep. I gradually ease my way past<br>the cops, who are nervously tapping their gloved hands with thick<br>black billyclubs, looking for heads to lay siege to.<br><br>Battling a towering urge to run, I walk briskly down the sidewalk,<br>each step taking me a little farther away from the scene of our crime.<br>My crime!<br><br>But it's not until all the commotion and noise around Cobo Hall<br>fade into the distance that I slow into a swaggering pimp walk, the<br>stolen rings and watches in my jacket pockets jingling melodiously.<br>The warm night air feels fantastic, thanks to a slight breeze fanning in<br>off the Detroit River.<br><br>Only after I've walked a few yards does it dawn on me that I'm<br>breathing pretty hard, not so much from exertion as from excitement.<br>Even though the palms of my hands are moist and my stomach feels<br>like a freight train is rumbling through it, I feel ecstatic.<br><br>A few blocks ahead a sea of dark Borsolino fedoras is bobbing<br>down the street and I jog to catch up.<br><br>The cops were so worried about the safety of the concertgoers that<br>they've left the rest of downtown unguarded, leaving the door open<br>for a frenzied Errol Flynn gang looting spree. Soon store alarms are<br>going off like crazy, punctuated by the brittle sound of storefront windows<br>disintegrating. In no time the sidewalk is littered with glass<br>shards that twinkle like diamonds under the streetlights and crunch<br>underfoot.<br><br>Smiling, I saunter into Cousins, one of the premier clothing stores<br>in downtown Detroit, and head straight for a hat rack at the far end<br>of the darkened store. The store is filled with the fantastic odor of<br>leather that emanates from expensive jackets and shoes neatly lined<br>up on display. It's a smell I've always equated with wealth.<br><br>The leather looks tantalizing and I shoot an admiring glance as I<br>hurriedly pass, headed toward my primary targets.<br><br>I have them in view now--two authentic Borsalino Como felt fur<br>fedoras, painstakingly handcrafted in Alessandra, Italy. Taking off my<br>fake fur Borsalino knockoff, I fling it into a corner, then slip the genuine<br>article onto my Jeri-curled head. As soon as the baby soft felt fur<br>caresses my shoulder-length locks, I immediately understand why<br>Comos are priced at $100 apiece.<br><br>Not to mention why they're the favored headgear of the top Detroit<br>pimps and hustlers that I look up to.<br><br>With one Borsalino on my head and another in my hand, I bolt<br>out of Cousins and back onto the street, before the pigs start responding<br>to all the jangling store alarms.<br><br>Feeling like a kid on Christmas morning, I eagerly make my way<br>back to the 1968 Camaro that my five-man crew and I parked several<br>blocks from Cobo Hall. I can't wait to divvy up the booty we've lifted<br>from the Average White Band crowd and I'm looking forward to seeing<br>how the eleven o'clock news covers our audacious heist.<br><br>My boys and I have just ripped off several thousand Detroit concertgoers<br>inside a major auditorium located mere blocks from police<br>headquarters.</p><h2>The Singing Knives</h2><p>Poetry. THE SINGING KNIVES, originally published in 1971 by Broughton&#39;s Mill Mountain Press, is Frank Sanford&#39;s first collection of poetry. Reprinted by his own press, Lost Roads Publisher, after his death, THE SINGING KNIVES, debuts the work of a twenty-something year old boy way ahead of his time and in a state of unrest, capturing &#34;poetry&#39;s more primal and mysterious possibilities&#34;-David Clewell. &#34;It is astonishing to me that I was not even aware of this superbly accomplished and moving poet. There is a great deal of pain in the poems, but it is a pain that makes sense, a tragic pain whose meaning rises from the way the poems are so firmly molded and formed from within&#34;- James Wright.</p><p>Frank Stanford (August 1, 1948 - June 3, 1978) was a prolific American poet. He is most known for his epic THE BATTLEFIELD WHERE THE MOON SAYS I LOVE YOU, a labyrinthine, highly lexical book absent stanzas and punctuation. In addition, Stanford published six shorter books of poetry throughout his 20s, and three posthumous collections of his writings (as well as a book of selected poems) have also been published. Just shy of his 30th birthday, Stanford died on June 3, 1978, in his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the victim of three self-inflicted pistol wounds to the heart. In the three decades since, he has become somewhat of a cult figure in American letters.</p><h2>Wolfhelm</h2><p>Following the death of the Dragon Emperor, all hope for the future lies with the deceased sovereign&#39;s hatchlings, who are protected by a human warrior, his sorceress wife, and his best friend, Gryphon, against the dark god Ravager</p><p>Richard A.

Most of these aeroplanes flew some did not some were never even finished but all of them reflect the extraordinary vitality and sense of optimism that powered the aeronautical world before the future of the aeroplane began to become clearer in wartime. If the Wrights had not flown in 1903, one of the early French builders would very quickly have won the laurels for the first flight. Some of the machines appear in these pages probably for the first time in print; others are rarely seen. This collection serves as a kind of super Exposition Internationale de Locomotion A�rienne; readers are invited to enter the Grand Palais, as they might have in 1908 or 1909, to enjoy these marvelous aircraft.</p><p></p><h2>Tracers.

Two of the nation&#x2019;s earliest Jewish communities were founded in Savannah in 1733 and Charleston in 1749. By 1800, more Jews lived in Charleston than in New York City. Today, Jews comprise less than one half of one percent of the southern population but provide critical sustenance and support for their communities. Nonetheless, southern Jews have perplexed scholars. For more than a century, historians have wrestled with various questions. Why study southern Jewish history? What is the southern Jewish experience? Is southern Jewish culture distinctive from that of other regions of the country, and if so, why? Jewish Roots in Southern Soil: A New History addresses these questions through the voices of a new generation of scholars of the Jewish South. Each of this book&#x2019;s thirteen chapters reflects a response with particular attention paid to new studies on women and gender; black/Jewish relations and the role of race, politics, and economic life; popular and material culture; and the changes wrought by industrialization and urbanization in the twentieth century. Essays address historical issues from the colonial era to the present and in every region of the South. Topics include assimilation and American Jewish identity, southern Jewish women writers, the Jewish Confederacy, Jewish peddlers, southern Jewish racial identity, black/Jewish relations, demographic change, the rise of American Reform Judaism, and Jews in southern literature.</p><p>EITAN P.

Boldly asserting the power of place, it demonstrates Southern Jews negotiating complicated identities across time and space.

Simultaneous.</p><p>While doing research for his highly acclaimed first book, Low Life ( LJ 6/1/91), Sante was given access to the New York City Police Department Archives. There he discovered some 1400 photos and glass plate negatives dating from 1914 to 1918. This was all that remained of the department's once-vast evidence photo files; the rest had been trashed. Taken from the files, these 55 raw, stark photos of the dead--victims of murder or suicides--are both fascinating and horrifying, showing the bodies as they were found by the police in tenement rooms or in vacant lots. The images are accompanied by the author's comments and some excerpts from original newspaper reports of the events. In all, this is a striking and highly original piece of social history.

Miller, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Missouri Lib., St. Louis</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This slim volume contains a haunting collection of 55 black-and-white crime scene photographs made primarily between 1914 and 1918 by New York City police detectives investigating murders and suicides. Sante discovered this archive while researching Low Life, his history of the seamy side of old New York; he notes that these pictures survived when they were overlooked by workers who cleared out the former Police Headquarters in the mid-1980s by dumping most of the records into the East River. While Sante diligently attempts to resurrect the stories behind these images, readers learn less about what happened than about where it happened: about the bedrooms, hallways, railroad tracks, subway stations, cellars and barrooms of New York City 75 years ago. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Patio &amp; Stone: A Sunset Design Guide</h2><p>In this ultimate guide to creating beautiful outdoor living spaces that fit your home and your budget, you'll find the best ideas and advice, all in one beautiful place.

Searching far beyond our modern world's honking horns and buzzing machinery, he has sought out the truly wild places that remain, where natural soundscapes exist virtually unchanged from when the earliest humans first inhabited the earth.<br><br>Krause shares fascinating insight into how deeply animals rely on their aural habitat to survive and the damaging effects of extraneous noise on the delicate balance between predator and prey. But natural soundscapes aren't vital only to the animal kingdom; Krause explores how the myriad voices and rhythms of the natural world formed a basis from which our own musical expression emerged.<br><br>From snapping shrimp, popping viruses, and the songs of humpback whales-whose voices, if unimpeded, could circle the earth in hours-to cracking glaciers, bubbling streams, and the roar of intense storms; from melody-singing birds to the organlike drone of wind blowing over reeds, the sounds Krause has experienced and describes are like no others. And from recording jaguars at night in the Amazon rain forest to encountering mountain gorillas in Africa's Virunga Mountains, Krause offers an intense and intensely personal narrative of the planet's deep and connected natural sounds and rhythm.<br><br><i>The Great Animal Orchestra</i> is the story of one man's pursuit of natural music in its purest form, and an impassioned case for the conservation of one of our most overlooked natural resources-the music of the wild. <br><br></p><p>Dr. Bernie Krause is both a musician and a naturalist. During the 1950s and 60s, he devoted himself to music and replaced Pete Seeger as the guitarist for The Weavers. For over 40 years, Krause has traveled the world recording and archiving the soundsof creatures and environments large and small. He has recorded over 15,000 species. He lives in California."An imaginative introduction to a new dimension of the natural world."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></i></b><br><br>"Krause's musical expertise allows him to hear the orchestral layering of different species in each biophony, an insight that explains group vocalization as an evolutionary survival mechanism rather than a purposeful chorus of noise."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Great Animal Orchestra </i>speaks to us of an ancient music to which so many of us are deaf. Bernie Krause is, above all, an artist. I have watched him recording the calls of chimpanzees, the singing of the insects and birds, and seen his deep love for the harmonies of nature. In this book he helps us to hear and appreciate the often hidden musicians in a new way. But he warns that these songs, an intrinsic part of the natural world and essential to human well being, are vanishing, one by one, snuffed out by human actions.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>No Further Questions</h2><p>The compulsive thriller from the Sunday Times bestselling author of Everything but the Truth and Anything You Do Say.

The subjects, including Omaha Indian sisters Susette and Susan LaFlesche and Katherine Ryan (aka Klondike Kate), are indeed noteworthy for their accomplishments. Former slave Biddy Mason became a prominent real-estate owner in Los Angeles and one of the first African-American women to own land in California. Mary McGladery Tape, a Chinese immigrant, fought school segregation in San Francisco. Others, however, like the actress Lotta Crabtree, grew up in the West but made their mark all over the country. Ketchum strives to show how the still-forming West shaped these people, but sometimes this attempt is strained. The women shine without the connection. The author notes in the prologue that she researched her subjects' diaries and letters, and the effort shows in the depth of characterization. Black-and-white photos add an extra dimension to their stories. A chapter on their legacies is appended. For a more wide-ranging collection, try Judy Alter's Extraordinary Women of the American West (Children's, 1999).<br><i>Carol Fazioli, formerly at The Brearley School, New York City </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-12. Not famous leaders or men, but eight pioneer women are the heroes in this collective biography about the historic American West. In fact, readers will wonder why they didn't know about these amazing people before. Ketchum weaves the individual biographies with the general history of the time: the first woman physician in the Pacific Northwest; the Omaha Indian sisters who fought for their people's rights; the slave who demanded her freedom in California and became one of the wealthiest--and most generous--women in Los Angeles; the Chinese orphan who came to California as a child and later fought for her own children's civil rights; the Canadian woman who explored the Klondike; and more. Ketchum chose individuals who left some written records, including diaries, letters, newspaper accounts. Her narrative is clear and direct, not reverential, but certainly admiring of the brave women who went so far. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

An identification and value guide for a century's worth of collectible American and English jewelry, this title consists of three main sections: "When Was It Made and What Is It Worth?," "100 Years of Cameos," and "Manufacturing Techniques." Each of six chapters in the first section covers a specific time and stylistic period; historical information introduces each of the chapters. The entries provide the date, a brief written description, and the price value of each piece, augmented by more than 1700 photographs, some in color. Prices are either from an auction house, collector, or dealer, with the source used indicated for every entry. Helpful appendixes cover how to date jewelry, distinguish metals, authenticate pieces, and identify designer and trademarks. The unfortunate absence of an index limits access; however, the table of contents is detailed.

Now the subject of a retrospective at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (where Sylvester is guest curator), his automotive art gets an obligatory academic tribute in this shiny catalogue. Besides the metallic pieces, Chamberlain also makes bulging urethane-foam cushions that, according to the text, evoke "surrogate flesh." But that's not all: this versatile experimenter also crushes aluminum foil and paints it with lacquer; creates bubble-like contraptions from synthetic polymer resin; and crushes paper, then paints it with resin. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.see Selz, Peter.

Though select women in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Egypt, and Pakistan ``lift the veil of silence'' here to speak out against Islamic law, Goodwin focuses on the vast majority of Muslim women, who--willingly or not--are lowering the veil over their faces and lives. In much of the Middle East, egalitarian strides made between the 50s' and 70's have been reversed in the past 20 years of surging conservative Islamic movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, and in this atmosphere women are singled out as potential sources of corruption. In Pakistan, for example, nurses are frequently accused of being immoral because they must work at night and care for male patients. All female government employees are ordered to wear Islamic dress, including chadors, which cover the head and most of the body. And while ``rapists are allowed to go free...women victims are prosecuted.'' Most Muslim women, contends Goodwin, are given fewer rights than the Koran is designed to give them. While women must be virgins when married, men are encouraged to be polygamous: ``Hefty financial inducements are offered, and women themselves are encouraged personally to select another wife for their husbands.'' The few who speak out against such policies risk unemployment, isolation, or even death. With disturbingly graphic detail, Goodwin documents cruelties visited on Muslim women--using skills similar to those she employed in covering Russian atrocities against Afghans in Caught in the Crossfire (1987). Despite shrill polemics in an anti-Israel chapter: a significant book that gives a voice to millions of silent and silenced Muslim women. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Previously a deputy foreign editor at the <i>Times,</i> he now writes editorials for the paper about government, politics, and international subjects, including the battles over taxes in the last two presidential elections. He lives with his wife, Elisabeth Bumiller, and family in the Washington, D.C., area.<p><b>Chapter One: "Circumstances Most Unpropitious and Forbidding"</b><br> <i>The Civil War Begins</i> </p><p> "Money!" Abraham Lincoln exclaimed. "I don't know anything about 'money.'" </p><p> The President was typically modest, evasive and adept at feigning ignorance when he did not want to be pinned down. At a meeting with a delegation of New York bankers and financiers well into the Civil War, Lincoln fully understood that the United States needed money to save the Union. So did Lincoln's anxious Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase. From the conflict's outset, the Union had had to fight while nearly broke. Chase's initial estimate after the taking of Fort Sumter was that the war would cost $320 million. After all, most experts figured at the time, the war could not last long -- "two or three months at the furthest," the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> predicted -- so the Treasury Department's first proposal was for three-quarters of the money to be borrowed from banks. Once the war was over, the money would be repaid quickly, Chase and others thought. But after the first months passed, the optimistic predictions unraveled, leaving the Treasury only $2 million on hand in the summer of 1861. While Union soldiers reeled from defeat after defeat, the banks balked at the administration's demands for loans, especially at the federal requirement that loans be paid in gold and silver. </p><p> Lincoln and Chase had a basis for thinking that the Union's credit was good and its eventual prospects even better. The North's strengths in fighting the war derived from a two-to-one advantage over the South in population, income and wealth. The Union side also had a 300 percent advantage in railroad miles, a powerful industrial foundation and vast holdings of unoccupied public land, including the gold-producing regions of the West. But these were assets not easily transformed into the cash to equip and send armies into battle. For months the banks warned Lincoln and Chase that reliance on borrowing when the future was uncertain was risky and potentially inflationary. One such warning was delivered to the Treasury Secretary when he traveled to New York for a private meeting in 1861 with the barons of capitalism at the New York Customs House near Wall Street, where financiers gathered from across the Northeast region. The Secretary was there to discuss the sale of new twenty-year bonds, but the low interest rate of 7 percent and the request that the bonds be purchased in gold unsettled the bankers in the room. They felt that the Treasury Department was looking on them as some sort of bottomless reserve, when the banks' solvency was actually very precarious. </p><p> Chase comprehended their situation at one level, but he also viewed the banks' reluctance to buy the bonds as arrogant and unpatriotic. The Treasury Secretary knew about the dangers of inflation, but he did have a war to fight, and he would do what was needed. He warned that, if necessary, he was prepared to print money to pay for the war, even if the price of a breakfast rose to $1,000. The banks were sympathetic, but they wanted to know about the prospects of repayment. At one point, James Gallatin of National Bank of New York, the son of Thomas Jefferson's Treasury Secretary, spoke up. What if more military reverses occurred? What if Britain or France intervened on the side of the Confederacy? What if the war went on not for months but for years? Another banker threatened to stop doing business with the federal government altogether unless Washington did something to shore up federal finances. His comment came across to the Treasury Secretary as a threat. </p><p> "No!" Chase fired back. "It is not the business of the secretary of the Treasury to receive an ultimatum, but to declare one if necessary." </p><p> By the end of 1861, Chase and Lincoln pried $150 million from the banks at 7.3 percent interest, but at great cost to the solvency of both the banks and the nation. As the men at the Customs House had feared, their reserves were so far gone that they had to suspend payments in gold and silver to their own customers. Soon afterward, the federal government followed suit, unable to honor its own payments with gold. These were brutal blows to Union credit. Without revenues, the federal government would not be able to turn to the banks again for more loans. More revenues meant only one thing: more taxes. That requirement would mean a new kind of tax, with far-reaching impact on the nation's finances. </p><p> Within the next six months, on July 1, 1862, Lincoln signed the first federal income tax in United States history. It was a momentous piece of legislation, rivaling, in its way, the abolition of slavery, the Homestead Act, the establishment of a national currency and federal bank regulation. Enactment of an income tax ushered in a new era of thinking about who should pay, who should sacrifice and who should gain from the federal government at a time of war. It established what until then was considered a revolutionary principle: the idea of taxing rich people at a higher rate compared to the rate for people less well off. Yet once established, that principle became a permanent feature of the American political and economic landscape. </p><p><br> The story of how the financial crisis of the Civil War led to a progressive income tax is a story not simply of war but also of the tumultuous economic and political change brought on by a new industrial age. The tax was essential to saving the Union and freeing the slaves. And although the tax was repealed shortly after the war ended, it left a monumental legacy by redefining the relationship between wealth and fairness. The Civil War income tax was a benchmark for how much America had been transformed in the first half of the nineteenth century. It established a foundation for the changes to come in the century's second half and for the years after that. </p><p> The tax that was enacted during the heat of a national crisis resulted from many decades of growth and change. Before the Civil War, the United States was populated primarily east of Kansas and on the Pacific coast. It was dominated by small business and farmers dependent on staples and manufactured goods from abroad. Americans kept their investments in their communities, and they used local currencies issued by their own banks. Thousands of different paper currencies, some issued by banks and some simply bogus, circulated as money among Americans. The national government was tiny, with little power to oversee this chaos. The government delivered the mail, collected tariffs and oversaw foreign affairs, but did little else. The Army when Lincoln took office had about 16,000 men, barely enough to protect Americans from Indians. Such was Washington's complacency that in June of 1860, the House Ways and Means Committee eliminated $1 million from a naval appropriations bill to repair and equip vessels. "I am tired of appropriating money for the army and navy when, absolutely, they are of no use whatsoever," said one member of Congress. </p><p> Complacency was perhaps understandable. No serious external threat cast a shadow on the prosperity achieved by America in the first half of the nineteenth century. After 1815, nothing seemed to stand in the way as Americans conquered, settled, annexed and purchased new territory, quadrupling the nation's size and population. Exports grew nearly two-and-a-half times in 50 years, to $243 million. In the South, King Cotton dominated world markets, supplying the mills of New England and Europe and enriching shippers, lenders and other middlemen based in New York. From 1817 to 1837, the output of the textile industry in New England rose from 4 million yards of cotton cloth to 308 million. The system of interchangeable parts revolutionized the production of machinery and arms, enabling the United States to surpass Britain in industrial might. Factories required workers. Waves of immigrants joined with Americans from the farm regions to pour into the great American metropolises seeking the means to improve their lot. Crammed into sweat shops, mills, mines and factories, workers grew restive, demanding better wages and conditions and sometimes going on strike. </p><p> At the other end of the spectrum, the wealthy of America were no longer simply the owners of large plantations and estates. They were a new breed of businessmen called "merchant capitalists" and "industrialists," people whose wealth was in stocks and bonds rather than property. There were plenty of domestic tensions revolving around economic issues. Farmers and workers regarded the wealthy new class of bankers, lawyers, merchants and speculators as "capitalists" and "bloodsuckers." On the whole, however, Americans were a prosperous people, even though they endured many cycles of boom and bust. Their average income doubled in a half century, and they could afford to buy goods that once had been transported by small ships and flatboats and now arrived on large ships and by roads and rail. New canals and railways enabled farmers to produce and sell their food in what had become for the first time a national market for goods. A revolution in communications allowed news to travel by telegraph. Newspapers and magazines were read by a growing middle class. </p><p> Few Americans doubted that these good times were the product of the hard work, industriousness and thrift of the most blessed new citizens of the world. But because there was now a national marketplace, the federal government stepped in to play a critical role by chartering the banks, licensing the corporations, digging the canals and sponsoring the railroads that laid a foundation upon which the nation could grow. To carry out these functions at the federal level required revenue. But on the eve of the Civil War, Americans were not used to paying anything to support their national government except indirectly, through the tariff. The federal excise tax on alcohol had been repealed in 1817. In the 1850s, the federal government obtained 92 percent of its revenues from customs duties imposed on goods imported from abroad. While protecting domestic industry from competing with cheap imports, the tariffs raised the price of nearly all goods consumed by Americans, from clothing to farm equipment. It was the tariff that paid America's way, which is why it was for so long so contentious an issue in American politics. </p><p> Tariffs were like a silent sales tax. Though regressive in nature, falling more onerously on the poor than on the rich, tariffs were accepted by Americans because they shared a broad assumption that everyone, producer and consumer alike, gained materially from the government's role in nurturing domestic industry and jobs. Indeed, without tariffs, the United States would have made a much slower transition from its status as a nation with an agrarian-based economy, rich in resources but lacking in capital investment, into the mighty industrial power it became after the Civil War. Debates about the tariff rose and fell throughout the nineteenth century, but without significant damage to the broad consensus in their favor. Democrats supported what Andrew Jackson termed a "judicious tariff," while Whigs, and later Republicans, pushed for higher tariffs to protect industries to fulfill their vision of development and enrich their political base. In the 1840s and 1850s, the anti-tariff forces managed to keep trade barriers reasonably low. Then came the Panic of 1857, a calamitous recession, after which Republicans succeeded in enacting the higher tariffs that they argued were needed to protect jobs and industry from foreign competition. </p><p> These were some of the economic conditions on the eve of the Civil War. By the end of the conflict, the Union demand for money to prosecute the war sent tariffs to record levels. American citizens paid higher prices for virtually everything they purchased. To persuade Americans that the wealthy citizens who were prospering from the war would bear more of its cost, Congress and the President turned in 1862 to the income tax, as well as taxes on corporations. Taxes, for the first time, were imposed on people's incomes, at graduated rates. A new bureaucracy was established to collect these charges, the Internal Revenue Bureau. </p><p> Taxpaying in wartime, when sacrifice is demanded from everyone, is shouldered more willingly than in times of peace. During the Civil War, it was borne to save the Union and free the slaves. And for the first time, taxation was also conceived and understood as an instrument that reduced inequality in a time of economic upheaval, when new fortunes were being made, in part out of war profits. As one lawmaker put it during a heated tax debate in the House, referring to two families that had grown rich during the war: "Go to the Astors and Stewarts and other rich men of the country and ask them if in the midst of a war [the income tax] is unreasonable. I could not advocate anything else in justice to the middle classes of the country." </p><p><br> To many visitors who traveled to Springfield after the 1860 election, Abraham Lincoln seemed overwhelmed. </p><p> The President-elect had an unsettling habit of pledging firmly to protect the Constitution and then throwing in a stream of jokes and homespun anecdotes. As the news arrived of one state after another seceding, he was noncommittal about what he planned to do. He had just won a precarious victory with less than 40 percent of the popular vote, and many people around him wondered whether he was up to the challenge of preserving the Union. At the beginning of this strange period of testing, Lincoln, perhaps reflecting some kind of private uncertainty about himself, surprised his friends by suddenly growing a beard. </p><p> For all his historic majesty, Lincoln in retrospect is a figure of puzzling contradictions. He was a man of action with doubts about the efficacy of action, a fatalist and an idealist, a farsighted thinker who could be slippery and reactive. We think of Lincoln as a great visionary, but he came across to many of his colleagues as pragmatic. "My policy is to have no policy," he said. The biographer David Herbert Donald attributes to Lincoln in action that quality defined by Keats as "negative capability," the ability to live with uncertainty, doubt, mystery and the avoidance of "any irritable reaching after fact and reason." Yet he could come to a sharp decision when history required. </p><p> Lincoln's economic views are more easily definable, but they, too, derived from a mixture of high principle, philosophy and practical politics, as well as from lessons that he had learned from his own life's varied experiences. Long before the war, starting at least when he was in his early twenties, these views embraced rugged individualism and aggressive government -- a belief that capitalism rested on both the dignity of labor and state intervention. As the biographer and historian Gabor S. Boritt notes, his image was tailor-made to represent the virtues of hard work in a free society. His nickname, "the Rail Splitter," harkened back to "Old Hickory" for Andrew Jackson and "Tippecanoe" for the war hero William Henry Harrison of the "Log Cabin" campaign of 1840. But it mainly helped Lincoln project himself as a classic self-made man, whose industry would be as good for the country as it had been good ...</p></p><h2>The Unexpected George Washington: His Private Life</h2><p><b>Advance Praise for <i>The Unexpected George Washington</i></b><p></p><p>""This is a biography that unquestionably lives up to its title.

Acclaimed as "America's most readable historian," Harlow Giles Unger reveals the humor, warmth, and genius of the intensely human man behind the stern presidential portraits and the stone face at Mount Rushmore. Washington was a passionate man who laughed, loved, and lived life to the full; he adored women, children, plants and flowers, hunting, gambling, fine wines, and luxuries of every kind. A dashing giant of a man, he was the greatest horseman of his day, yet his social graces left ladies swooning as he spun them around the ballroom&#x2014;and his funny tales left children convulsing with giggles as he bounced them gently on his knee.<p></p><p>More than Franklin, more than Jefferson, Washington was a genius&#x2014;a scientist, inventor, architect, scholar, and entrepreneur. His brilliant intellect and ingenuity pioneered advances in agriculture, botany, animal husbandry, architecture, and mechanics that revolutionized American farming for the next century&#x2014;and left us the uniquely American architectural masterpiece that stands at Mount Vernon.</p><p>Left fatherless at eleven, Washington instinctively reached out to children in the same strait, befriending, harboring, often raising as his own the nieces, nephews, and children of relatives or friends, including his wife Martha's two children by her first husband and two of her grandchildren. Even in war, he nurtured the young, encouraging and training junior officers for leadership&#x2014;and all but adopting the young Marquis de Lafayette as "my own son." </p><p>Drawing on private letters, diaries, and neglected primary sources, Unger introduces the Father of Our Country as a glorious, thoroughly human person few Americans know existed: a man who bellowed at the misbehavior of his spoiled grandson, but shed uncontrollable tears at the death of Martha's two children&#x2014;and embraced Lafayette's sixteen-year-old son as his own when the boy fled bloodthirsty French revolutionaries to seek safe haven at Mount Vernon.</p><p>The Unexpected George Washington is also a thrilling love story&#x2014;a deep, lifelong romance marked by tragedy and danger, but filled with boundless happiness and mutual understanding. Martha shared George's love of dancing, theater, concerts, expensive clothes, fine furnishings, and lavish dinners&#x2014;and she put up with his passions for drink, cards, horse racing, hunting, and bawdy jokes. Both reveled in the society of relatives, friends, and small children, and Martha filled their mansion with all three. Generous, hospitable, concerned for others, Washington left all who knew or met him in awe. Then, as now, he inspired trust, loyalty, love, and reverence.</p><b>HARLOW GILES UNGER</b> is a graduate of Yale University and the author of fifteen books, including the award-winning Lafayette, as well as biographies of John Hancock and Noah Webster.

Animals have a keen sense of time.</p><p>Okay, okay, he says. The dog sits in the middle of the kitchen, trying not to slump over. Her chest is robust, yet she sits in a manner which suggests her stiff front legs are propping her up. Her triangular eyes are narrowed to slits; her tongue hangs from her dark mouth. She&#x2019;s making sure everything is all right, that they&#x2019;ll get through for the time being. She mumbles long and loud, a sound not dissimilar to his stomach when he&#x2019;s hungry.</p><p>Good girl, he says to her, not knowing if he needs or loves this dog any more.</p><p>Maccy cheese and chicken Vienna sausages will be their meal tonight. This is what his daughter likes. They&#x2019;ve eaten it the last three nights; very little else will tempt her. Maybe he&#x2019;ll add a tin of peas. She&#x2019;s lying in the huge double bed in the bedroom, like a mermaid on a raft, watching <i>Casper the Friendly Ghost</i>. November and it&#x2019;s still raining, popcorn rain, almost every day, short dense showers, ten minutes of a mauve downpour and then nothing. It falls from the mountains all around, unbidden, and makes him feel like he&#x2019;s done something wrong, like he&#x2019;s been in an argument and was the one to say all the stupid things.</p><p>He opens the tin of chicken sausages and winces at the stink. Like the innards of a gym shoe, a stale acid smell. He spills the brine out into the sink.</p><p>Here, have one of these, he says to the dog. He prongs a short brownpink sausage and holds it close to the dog&#x2019;s muzzle. She sniffs it but doesn&#x2019;t take a bite.</p><p>Go <i>on</i>, try it, he cajoles.</p><p>She sniffs again and puts her snout to the sausage. She nibbles it like a Japanese lady might nibble on a rose petal.</p><p>Oh, for God&#x2019;s sakes.</p><p>She takes the sausage carefully in her mouth and then slides to the floor and drops it on the lino. She looks up at him and mumbles.</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>To be this close to collapse is a soft feeling. All his inner fibre, all his strength is ungluing and stretching and he can feel himself going stringy, like he could just come apart. It will be a tender experience, like falling in love. Yes, surely dying, losing, failing, giving up, are similar to all the great uplifting feelings; surely dying is like being born.</p><p>He fills the saucepan with a jet of water, sits it on the hob and watches the ring turn candy red. The water is cloudy from the tap. As he watches it clear he puts his hand on his chest to check his heart. He scratches his beard. Black flies flit to the stove and he grabs the electric flyswatter, shaped like a small tennis racket. He swats one, <i>smack</i>, and the fly fries on the lines. It sizzles and forms a small black lump.</p><p>Ha, ha, <i>see</i>, he says to the dog. I&#x2019;m still dangerous.</p><p>He swats another fly, smacking the racket down on the counter top. Another good shot, another sizzling sound. The racket smokes.</p><p><i>Smack, smack.</i> Two more flies get mashed and charred. He picks at his T-shirt, and fans it against his stomach; a small sweat has broken out. Maybe he, Gavin Weald, isn&#x2019;t dying, after all. Maybe he is Godzilla, the Great Ape; maybe he will destroy and conquer all.</p><p>Daddy?</p><p>The dog looks round at the little girl in the hallway.</p><p>He looks at her too.</p><p>Yes, dou dou.</p><p>What&#x2019;s for dinner?</p><p>It&#x2019;s a surprise, he says, hiding the racket behind his back. He towers over her, and yet he feels her strength; she can make louder sounds than he can. She can sob for a whole night, not eat for days, throw tantrums which spin themselves from nowhere. Or spin themselves from her new fear, the rain which bounds down from the hills. She is six and small and oh, so powerful.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want a surprise.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll like this surprise, guaranteed.</p><p>She shakes her head which makes her blonde hair sway around her face.</p><p>What then?</p><p>Pizza.</p><p>Pizza? Since when did you prefer pizza?</p><p>With anchovies please.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t even know what an anchovy is.</p><p>Yes I do.</p><p>He drops to his knees. He holds the flyswatter like a real tennis racket, across his shoulder, affecting the style of a pro, forgetting the charred lumps.</p><p>What is an anchovy, then?</p><p>It&#x2019;s a fish.</p><p>Oh, he nods. This is unexpected. When did she learn about anchovies? Captain Nemo, yes, but an anchovy?</p><p>A fish? You mean like a whale?</p><p>Nooooo, she shrieks at his stupidity. They&#x2019;re tiny, like a shrimp.</p><p>A shrimp?</p><p>She laughs and her face glows. The dog&#x2019;s tail thumps the ground.</p><p>Oc�an, I&#x2019;m sorry, but we don&#x2019;t have anchovies. Nor whales, nor any kind of fish, and anyway, anchovies taste horrible.</p><p>I love anchovies.</p><p>You&#x2019;ve never even tried one!</p><p>Yes I have.</p><p>Look, we&#x2019;re having your favourite tonight, maccy cheese and . . . He looks at the sausage on the lino still between the dog&#x2019;s paws . . . And then we are having ice cream with peas. That was the surprise; I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to tell you. It&#x2019;s a secret recipe. Now go away &#x2013; and leave me to cook.</p><p>Ha. She&#x2019;s outfoxed. Her face is pensive, trying to work out what to do next. He&#x2019;s losing his marbles and the one good thing about it is that he can now defuse a pre- tantrum six-year-old.</p><p>Go on now. She turns and he paddles her behind with the racket full of burnt flies.</p><p>She wanders back to the bedroom and the TV.</p><p>The water in the pan bubbles furiously and he opens a packet and throws the pasta in to boil and waits, stirring and stabbing it with a wooden spoon. When it&#x2019;s soft, he drains the tubes, throws them back in the pan. He takes the sachet of macaroni cheese mix and tears it open, sprinkling it in. The grey powder dissolves in a puff and the pasta coagulates into a stiff mess at the bottom. He pours in milk, adds a knob of butter. He prods and stirs, prising the pasta into separate pieces and the powder starts to become thinner and lighter in texture, like a miracle; it even starts to smell like cheese.</p><p>They eat together at the table. He doesn&#x2019;t attempt conversation for fear of where it might lead. Anchovies, rain. Mummy. Cheesy steam lifts from the pot of macaroni, sedating them. Next to it, a bowl of grated cheddar, slices of bread and butter. He scoops some macaroni into her bowl and her eyes grow wide and dilated at the sight of the starchy goo.</p><p>Yum, yum, he says and means it. He sprinkles the real cheese on top and puts the bowl down in front of her. She holds her fork like a trident and gazes into the bowl, inhaling deeply. One day she&#x2019;ll fall asleep into her macaroni.</p><p>Yum, yum, he says again to himself, as he scoops a triple helping and takes a fistful of cheddar.</p><p>They both hum while eating their food. She sucks whole tubes down in one, blows them out onto the table. He doesn&#x2019;t care to correct her. He picks at his food and he strokes at his heart; he chews slowly, trying not to drift too far away. He especially tries not to think of the office, of what he&#x2019;ll have to face tomorrow, Monday.</p><p>They&#x2019;ve been back in the house exactly twelve days. Twelve days within these pink walls. Tomorrow is day thirteen. When he thinks of the office nothing comes. He can&#x2019;t conjure up faces, &#x2018;to do&#x2019; lists, Mrs Cyrus his secretary of ten years, anything. Where is it all, that part of him? He was doing so well, the CEO of a good-sized company; it feels like years ago. His head is light and there&#x2019;s a churning in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Daddy, can I get down now?</p><p>Yes, pumpkin.</p><p>Will you watch TV with me?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>He dumps the dishes into the already dish-crammed sink and burps. The dog sits against the kitchen wall. He bends and strokes her behind the ears and she tilts her head for more. <i>Scratch, scratch</i>, good girl. Her bull terri- er &#x2019;s nose is long and Roman, a pink patch at the end like a piece of a ballet shoe, worn satin; the tip of her nose is black and cold, reassuring to touch. He fights the urge to sit down on the floor and hug the dog close.</p><p>Come on then, Suzy. Let&#x2019;s watch TV, he says.</p><p>The dog gets up and he pats her side. She trots after him, tail up, and they both climb on to the kingsize bed with the little girl on it. The three of them form them- selves into a kind of nest; the sheets around them are damp and smell of dog and feet. The Discovery Channel shows images of crocodiles in a place called Kakadu in Australia. Oc�an is transfixed. She is lying across his barrel chest and the dog is slumped across her legs. Immediately, as he tries to focus on the TV, his eyes feel heavy. Crocodiles, a creek somewhere, yellow eyes bulg- ing from the water. Sleep arrives quickly and he doesn&#x2019;t try to fight it off; it&#x2019;s usual for him to end his days like this, with his daughter clinging to him, with the feeling, deep down, that it&#x2019;s the other way around.</p><p>*</p><p>In the office on Monday his staff float around him. How much longer can they trust him? How much longer would<i> he</i> trust him if he were them? When will the Board of Directors call him in, Steve or Mr Grant, the owner of the company; how much longer before they give him unrealistic targets, start to discuss his benefits? He is No. 3 in the company, the one hired to run everything; they can always replace a No. 3. At first there was time off. Curiosity, sympathy, cards, flowers. He didn&#x2019;t discuss any of it. It was a relief to finally get back to work.</p><p>In his private office, he examines his hands. They are feathered with dead grey skin stained here and there with yellow where he&#x2019;s splashed antiseptic ointment on the slits. The skin is now paper-thin. He can type, but holding a steering wheel is difficult, tying his laces is painful. His feet are the same, skin peeling off in welts. Psoriasis. It set in a few months after the flood. He&#x2019;s tried everything now, all the steroid creams, the pills, hard drugs packed full of chemicals which made his hair fall out, his pubes wither. He&#x2019;s started seeing an alternative doctor who can read his &#x2018;vibrations&#x2019; on a little machine. He doesn&#x2019;t know or care exactly what this means. <i>You register a four</i>, the doctor says. Now he&#x2019;s been prescribed a glass of water every morning, with a squeeze of lime and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to alkalise his body.</p><p>At 11 a.m. he walks to the coffee machine for his fourth cup. It&#x2019;s the coffee. If he could give up coffee, his one vice, all his other problems would come good. He knows this is an underlying truth, that he cannot give up this black toxic liquid. If he could put this one little thing right, he could put everything right.</p><p>He smiles at Petula at reception and her eyes fill with love when she sees him; she&#x2019;s like a nun, so openly concerned. Only she has understood.</p><p>Hi Petula, he says and she beams. Petula, who is also so fertile &#x2013; five kids. So fertile she can make her glasses fog up just sitting there all day. Petula who, like the dog, has come to run his life.</p><p>Doughnut today, Mr Weald?</p><p>No thanks.</p><p>Potato pie?</p><p>Oh God, no.</p><p>What I can get fer you?</p><p>Nothing. Thank you.</p><p>He is still full of last night&#x2019;s macaroni cheese. He waddles to the men&#x2019;s room and stands in the cubicle, counting to ten. When his eyes are open he can see tiny filmy black snakes in the air in front of him; floaters, the optician calls them. It&#x2019;s weird watching them; they look like bacteria breeding in a Petri dish. He closes his eyes and puts his fingers to his temples. He tries to steady himself but that rising panicking butterfly feeling threat- ens to get the better of him. He holds his head in his hands and counts.</p>When he hears the bathroom door open he unzips his flies and lets a steady torrent of saffron yellow urine cascade from him.<p>Pissing, <i>ahhh</i>, it&#x2019;s like a strange dull orgasm. Maybe he could move in with Petula and her kids. Each one of them has a different father. All good-for-nothing layabouts. Maybe they could form a pod, a kind of double family. Or &#x2013; better still, maybe they could all live together in his pink house. Petula appears to him, through a haze, her glasses sparkling, her smile beatific. <i>Potato pie</i>? Maybe she could still work on reception here, but also be a kind of flatmate. Could that work?</p><p>Mr Weald?</p><p>Uh &#x2013; yes?</p><p>Mr Weald, is that you?</p><p>He panics, looking at his watch. Oh, <i>God</i>. A piercing realisation, no . . . no, please no. He has fallen asleep again, standing on his feet. His flies are still open, his dick hanging limp against his trousers. Petula. He was think- ing of her and then . . .</p><p>Mr Weald?</p><p>Yes, I&#x2019;m here. It sounds like Elston from the warehouse, a good man. He won&#x2019;t mention this to a soul.</p><p>You okay, Mr Weald?</p><p>He zips himself back up and opens the cubicle door.</p><p>Elston, I&#x2019;m fine. Was I snoring?</p><p>Yes, Mr Weald.</p><p>Well, I&#x2019;m fine. I just got a little lost in there; you know what it&#x2019;s like.</p><p>Elston&#x2019;s face is huge and incredulous.</p><p>Never mind, Gavin says quickly and leaves the men&#x2019;s. He goes back to his office and tells Mrs Cyrus not to bother him. He has piles of paperwork; he tells her to put no one through unless it&#x2019;s a dire emergency.</p><p>In his office he sits very still at his desk until his sense of humiliation quells and his heart slows again. He says some kind of prayer and in that moment an image of his old boat shimmers before him. <i>Romany</i>. His 28-foot sloop, his old mistress, his great friend. He thinks of her sitting in the olive green water, her wooden deck, her upturned bow; he knows he&#x2019;s clutching at straws.</p><p>Gavin hides in his office all day. Hours of hot itchy hands and a racing heart and a mind slipping all over the place: images of <i>Romany</i>, the boat from his bachelor days, appear and disappear like a ghost boat in a haze. His old boat has been sitting moored at the yacht club for over a year now; they&#x2019;d decided to sell her, finally. No time for boats any more, for sailing down the islands, for racing, nights gazing at the stars. His wife had never enjoyed sailing much. Then the flood came. By now, she is probably covered in pelican shit, full of rainwater.</p><p>He plays Solitaire online and then he plays Bridge. He checks Facebook seventeen times, checks for hurricanes, for sightings of UFOs, for information about Kakadu; then he finds all this checking makes his head spin even more. At 5 p.m., on the dot, he logs out and leaves the office without looking Mrs Cyrus in the eye.</p><p>*</p><p>At home Gavin stands on the lawn and scrutinises the pink garden walls. Seven feet high now, with buttresses, steel-enforced. Nothing will knock over these pink walls. What colour were they before? He can&#x2019;t remember; mostly they were covered with orange trumpety flowers, a climbing plant of some sort, other shrubs. Now the walls are candy pink, princess-pink, to make his daugh- ter happy. She chose these walls. He looks up and sniffs, he can smell the rain arriving anytime soon. The sky is heavy with thunderheads about to burst; the rainy season is a month from being over.</p><p>Daddy? Oc�an comes to him and holds onto his legs.</p><p>Yes, dou dou.</p><p>Can we have meatballs for dinner?</p><p>Yes, we can ha...</p></p><h2>Muslims and the Making of America</h2><p><p>"There has never been an America without Muslims"&#x2015;so begins Amir Hussain, one of the most important scholars&nbsp;and teachers&nbsp;of Islam in America. Hussain, who is himself&nbsp;an&nbsp;American Muslim, contends that Muslims played an essential role in the creation&nbsp;and cultivation&nbsp;of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>Memories of 9/11 and the rise&nbsp;of&nbsp;global terrorism&nbsp;fuel concerns about American Muslims. The fear of American Muslims in part stems from the stereotype that all followers of Islam are violent extremists who want to overturn the American way of life. Inherent to this stereotype is the popular misconception that Islam is a new religion to America.<br>&nbsp;<br>In&nbsp; <i>Muslims and the Making of America</i> Hussain directly addresses both of these stereotypes. Far from undermining America, Islam and American Muslims&nbsp;have been, and continue to be, important threads in the fabric of American life. Hussain chronicles the history of Islam in America to underscore the valuable cultural influence of Muslims on American life. He then&nbsp;rivets attention on music, sports, and culture as key areas in which Muslims have shaped and transformed American identity. America, Hussain concludes, would not exist as it does today without the essential contributions made by its Muslim citizens.</p></p><p><p>Amir Hussain is Professor of Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.</p><p>...Hussain has set out to prove that, far from being merely compatible with American values, Muslims have been at the center of the creation of American popular culture.</p> (James L.

Now, former mobster Louis Ferrante reveals its surprisingly effective management techniques and explains how to apply them-legally-to any legitimate business. As an associate of the Gambino family, Ferrante relied on his instincts to pull off some of the biggest heists in U.S. history. By the age of twenty-one, he had netted millions of dollars for his employers. His natural talent for management led Mafia bosses to rely on him. After being arrested and serving an eight-and-a-half-year prison sentence, Ferrante went straight. He realized that the Mob&#39;s most valuable business lessons would allow him to survive and thrive in the real world. Now he offers eighty-eight time-tested Mafia strategies, including: * Go get your own coffee!: Respecting the chain of command without being a sucker. * The walls have ears: Never bad-mouth the boss. * Is this phone tapped?: Watch what you say every day. * How to bury the hatchet-but not in someone&#39;s head. * Don&#39;t split yourself in half: The wrong decision is better than none at all. * Don&#39;t build Yankee stadium, just supply the concrete: Spotting new rackets. * Leave the gun, take the cannolis...and beware of hubris. Ferrante brings his real-life experiences to the book, offering fascinating advice that really works and sharing behind-the-scenes episodes almost as outrageous as those occurring on Wall Street every day.</p><p><b>Louis Ferrante</b> is a former Mafia associate and heist expert who served eight and a half years in prison after refusing to incriminate members of the Gambino family.

Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, they evolved into a seven-member &#x201c;brotherhood&#x201d; that included poets and critics as well as painters.</p><p>Moving away from the classical compositions exemplified by Raphael (hence the group&#x2019;s name), the Pre-Raphaelites rather turned to medieval culture and the jewel-like colors of Quattrocento art for inspiration. Their principal themes were initially religious, but also included subjects from literature and poetry, as exemplified by Sir John Everett Millais&#x2019;s famous Ophelia, drawn from Shakespeare's Hamlet. Inspired by the theories of John Ruskin, they were also committed to the close study of nature.</p><p>This book presents key works from the Pre-Raphaelite group to introduce their reactionary principles, their dazzling colors, their interest in love, death, and nature, and their extensive influence on latter-day Symbolism and beyond.</p></p><p>Heather Birchall a organis� plusieurs grandes expositions au Victoria and Albert Museum, ainsi qu&#x2019;� la Tate Britain de Londres, avant de devenir conservatrice du d�partement des Beaux-Arts de la Whitworth Art Gallery, � l&#x2019;Universit� de Manchester.

It purports to be a "complete guide to your favorite creatures," but the topic selection is erratic, to say the least. There are separate entries for Dracula, nosferatu, and vampire, while the entire stable of mythological creatures is listed in one entry?oddly alphabetized as "Monsters of Greek Mythology." Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, and cartoonist Gahan Wilson are lumped together under "Funny Monsters," and the Sesame Street muppets are entered as "Mini-Monsters." The writing style fluctuates wildly from straight information to sarcastic dialogue to Mad-magazinestyle comics without regard to the entry topic. The same lack of cohesiveness is evident in the illustrations. The cartoon drawings are moderately funny, but the pictures taken from monster films look like bad photocopies. Both often appear on the same page, which only emphasizes the contrast.

Religion and philosophy&#x2015;not economics or politics&#x2015;determine history and society. <br><br>Berdyaev begins his story in the nineteenth century, tracing the lineage of such powerful artists and thinkers as Chaadev, Khomyakov, Kireevksy, Leontyev, Aksakov, Hertzen, and Bakunin, all of whom struggled to integrate the polarities of East and West, spirit and matter, and male and female in the Russian soul. That soul, however, is so immense, boundless, and vague that it is incapable of settling for "the halfway kingdom of culture." Demanding all or nothing&#x2015;alternately apocalyptic and nihilistic&#x2015;Russians strove to justify culture and discover Russia's mystical mission. <br><br>Impatient with the slow pace of history, distrusting all authority, and yet haunted by a vision of unity, thinkers such as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Federov, and Solovyov created an original and vital religious philosophy that culminated in the Russian renaissance at the beginning of the twentieth century. The fruit of these great figures&#x2015;of whom Berdyaev was one (others included Florensky, Bulgakov, Rozanov, Merezhkovsky, Blok, and Bely)&#x2015;was cut short by the 1917 Revolution. <br><br>More recently, their works have been available in self-published (<i>Samizdat</i>) editions.

Left behind, the tight family unit of father and son grew up to be more like brothers than parent and child. Such an intense relationship created struggles and pain&#x2014;but also a form of independence that gave both men the mettle to face life alone when necessary. When Zebu was nineteen, he left behind his &#x201c;hippie on a Harley&#x201d; father in a brickyard on a cold winter day in Denver, Colorado, and set out with three things he knew he could rely on: strong boots, a warm coat, and a will to roam. <br><br>He took off down the road at sunset with his thumb out and a keen desire to see the world on his own terms.

Socialism appeared to sweep all before it, and the social democratic variety in the West was not much of an improvement. Mises set out to explain and bitterly denounce the trends toward the total state, and demonstrate that Communism and Nazism were both species of interventionism.</p> <p>Though Hayek's book <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> was more widely promoted, and achieved a far greater fame, this Mises work, which appeared in the same year, offers a more consistent critique of industrial central planning, warfare, and the welfare state. There are no concessions to the prevailing social democratic consensus, and Mises is no less harsh on interventionism of the democratic form. The last chapter is a prescient critique of the idea of world government, including world trade agreements.</p> <p>ISBN 0910884153 <br> 291 pp. (pb) </p></p><p>Omnipotent Government is not only a history of the fall of Germany, but also a powerful critique of the political, social, and economic ideologies that have shaped Western history in the last two hundred years. The ordeal of two World Wars, according to Mises, was the inevitable result of ideologies that call upon government for the management of human affairs. People today hail every step toward more government as &#34;progress,&#34; and call for more laws, regulations, and their enforcement by courts and police. They are yearning for Caesar. They forget the consequences of total government.

When the story opens, 12-year-old Makenna has just witnessed the murder of her mother, the local hedgewitch, by decree of a priest of the Hierarch, aided by the villagers whom Makenna's mother had always helped. Angry and bitter, the grieving girl seeks revenge on the village and runs away into the woods, where she encounters and befriends the goblins-a small, magical race of people who are being systematically exterminated by the Hierarch. Advance five years to another part of the Hierarch's territory and meet Tobin, a knight who takes the blame for his younger brother's role in an attempted coup. Tobin will be allowed to redeem himself by capturing the sorceress who has aligned herself with the goblins. This, of course, is Makenna. When the two young people meet, they discover that the world around them cannot be viewed as all good or all bad and together they attempt to provide a safe haven for both humans and goblins. Fantasy novels for young people do not often explore the gray areas, which makes for some interesting and thought-provoking reading here. However, Bell provides few transitions between times and places, making it difficult to discern what has happened and where readers are in this mythical world. This lack of transition detracts from an otherwise promising political fantasy.<br><i>Sharon Grover, Arlington County Department of Libraries, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ranters &amp; Crowd Pleasers: Punk in Pop Music, 1977-92</h2><p>A retrospective of the punk revolution retraces the history of punk music, from the arrival of the Sex Pistols in 1976 through the following decade and a half.

The big-picture-window connections that illuminate Lipstick Traces ( LJ 4/15/89), the classic Mystery Train ( LJ 4/1/75), and his recently published Dead Elvis (Doubleday, 1991) are apparent in this collection of punk and post-punk influence pieces, written between 1977 and 1991 for periodicals like New West (later California ) , Artforum, and the Village Voice. The Gang of Four, Delta 5, the Mekons, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, X-ray Spex, and, of course, the Sex Pistols and the Clash, are prominently featured, and looming throughout in the background are the creepy specters of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

Among these 95 were two African Americans, Alonzo Watson and Edward White. Watson would also be among the first to die on the Spanish battlefield. Nearly 3,000 Americans eventually joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and traveled to Spain to take up what has come to be called "the good fight". Among their number were about 90 African Americans. This book tells the little-known story of their role in what may be the least understood military conflict of the twentieth century.<br>African-American participation in the Spanish Civil War marks a turning point in American military history. Two decades before the official end of segregation in the U.S. armed forces, black volunteers in Spain fought side by side with white compatriots in the first fully integrated American fighting unit. Oliver Law, a native of Chicago's Southside who was to be killed in battle, served as the first black officer to command a primarily white battalion.<br>In joining "the good fight," the black brigadists also added an important chapter to the tradition of bravery and heroism that characterizes African Americans' long-lived struggle for freedom. Many saw the fight against fascism in Spain as a symbol of the unsung battles against racism and classism taking place in America and elsewhere. As one black soldier put it, in Spain "we have been able to strike back... at the counterparts of those who have been grinding us down back home."<br>Of particular significance to the African-American volunteers was the opportunity to avenge the Italian fascist invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Then the only independent African nation, Ethiopia held great historical, religious, and cultural value for black communities worldwide. Mussolini's attack outraged African Americans, but efforts to recruit soldiers to the Ethiopian cause were discouraged by the U.S. government and, consequently, by Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie. In Spain, where Francisco Franco's fascist army was supported by 50,000 Italian troops, black Americans could symbolically fulfill the moral obligation they had felt to defend Ethiopia. Spain wasn't Ethiopia, but it would do.<br>African Americans in the Spanish Civil War draws from the multitude of sources housed at the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, to chronicle the experiences of the black American men who served in Spain. A roll of veterans provides biographical sketches and describes the nature of each veteran's service. Reports from the war years by Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and others depict life at the battlefront. And oral testimonies by several veterans illuminate the personal reasons these men had for engaging in a war so far from home and the ways in which this experience influenced their lives. An introductory essay places African-American interest in the war in historical perspective.<br>The African Americans who fought in Spain were idealists. They saw in the struggle for Spanish democracy the opportunity to remake a part of the world and believed victory there would improve the chances for justice and equality at home. Their story is one of sacrifice, solidarity, and commitment. This volume represents a beginning in the recovery of that story.</p><p></p><h2>Building Plank on Frame Ship Models</h2><p>The plank-on-frame&#x201d; method is the pre-eminent ship modeling technique, and this practical manual is the foremost guide to its intricacies.

A homophobic serial killer with a penchant for opera. And a young woman&#39;s suicide that may yet turn out to be murder. On the surface, the events are unconnected, but then things - and people - aren&#39;t always what they seem. Detective Sergeant Duffy is the man tasked with trying to get to the bottom of it all. It&#39;s no easy job - especially when it turns out that one of the victims was involved in the IRA, but last seen discussing business with someone from the UVF. Add to that the fact that as a Catholic policemen, it doesn&#39;t matter which side he&#39;s on, because nobody trusts him - and Sergeant Duffy really is in a no-win situation. Fast-paced, evocative and brutal, &#34;The Cold, Cold Ground&#34; is a brilliant depiction of Belfast at the height of the Troubles - and a cop treading a thin, thin line.</p><p>Adrian McKinty grew up in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland. After studying at Oxford University he moved to New York City, working in bars, bookstores, building sites and finally the basement stacks of the Columbia University Medical School Library. In 2000 he relocated to Denver, Colorado where he taught high school English and began writing fiction. His debut Dead I Well May Be [9781846686993] was shortlisted for the Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award, while Fifty Grand [9781846687419] won the 2010 Spinetingler Award and was longlisted for the 2011 Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year. His most recent work was Falling Glass [9781846687822]. In 2009 Adrian moved to Melbourne, Australia with his wife and two children.The Cold Cold Ground is a razor sharp thriller set against the backdrop of a country in chaos, told with style, courage and dark-as-night wit. Adrian McKinty channels Dennis Lehane, David Peace and Joseph Wambaugh to create a brilliant novel with its own unique voice -- Stuart Neville It&#39;s undoubtedly McKinty&#39;s finest . . . Written with intelligence, insight and wit, McKinty exposes the cancer of corruption at all levels of society at that time. Sean Duffy is a compelling detective, the evocation of 19802 Northern Ireland is breathtaking and the atmosphere authentically menacing. A brilliant piece of work which does for NI what Peace&#39;s Red Riding Quartet did for Yorkshire -- Brian McGilloway McKinty&#39;s prose is a master-class in vicious poise . . . Be in no doubt that this novel is a masterpiece: had David Peace, Eoin McNamee and Brian Moore sat down, they would have been very pleased indeed to have written The Cold Cold Ground -- Declan Burke The Cold Cold Ground is a fearless trip into Northern Ireland in the 1980s: riots, hunger strikes, murders - yet Adrian McKinty tells a very personal story of an ordinary cop trying to hunt down a serial killer&#39; -- John McFetridge McKinty&#39;s The Cold Cold Ground has got onto on my five best books of the year list as it is riveting, brilliant and just about the best book yet on Northern Ireland -- Ken Bruen The Cold Cold Ground confirms McKinty as a writer of substance... The names of David Peace and Ellroy are evoked too often in relation to young crime writers, but McKinty shares their method of using the past as a template for the present. The stories and textures may belong to a different period, but the power of technique and intent makes of them the here and now... There&#39;s food for thought in McKinty&#39;s writing... The Cold Cold Ground is a crime novel, fast-paced, intricate and genre to the core. -- Eoin McNamee * Guardian * Adrian McKinty is the voice of the new Northern Irish generation but he&#39;s not afraid to examine the past. This writer is a legend in the making and The Cold, Cold Ground is the latest proof of this -- Gerard Brennan Detective Sergeant Sean Duffy could well become a cult figure... McKinty has not lost his touch or his eye for the bizarre and the macabre, or his ear for the Belfast accent and argot. ...McKinty creates a marvellous sense of time and place... he manages to catch the brooding atmosphere of the 1980s and to tell a ripping yarn at the same time... There will be many readers waiting for the next adventure of the dashing and intrepid Sergeant Duffy. -- Maurice Hayes * Irish Independent * McKinty (has) a razor sharp ear for the local dialogue and a feeling for the bleak time and place that was Ulster in the early Eighties, and pair them with a wry wicked wit... If Raymond Chandler had grown up in Northern Ireland, The Cold Cold Ground is what he would have written. -- Peter Millar * The Times * Adrian McKinty is fast gaining a reputation as the finest of the new generation of Irish crime writers, and it&#39;s easy to see why on the evidence of this novel, the first in a projected trilogy of police procedurals. At times The Cold Cold Ground has the feel of James Ellroy, the prose is that focused and intense, but then there are moments of darkest humour, with just a hint of the retro feel of Life On Mars thrown in. The complex plotting and acidic dialogue here are the equal of any crime writer around, and the story rattles along at a breakneck pace, but there is also an earthy eloquence to McKinty&#39;s prose that raises it above the level of the average police procedural. -- Doug Johnstone * Herald * Detective SErgeant Sean Duffy could well become a cult figure... McKinty manages to catch the brooding atmosphere of the 1980s and to tell a ripping yarn at the same time&#39; -- Maurice Hayes * Belfast Telegraph * The setting represents an extraordinarily tense scenario in itself, but the fact that Duffy is a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant RUC adds yet another fascinating twist to McKinty&#39;s neatly crafted plot... a masterpiece of Troubles crime fiction: had David Peace, Eoin McNamee and Brian Moore sat down to brew up the great Troubles novel, they would have been very pleased indeed to have written The Cold Cold Ground. -- Declan Burke * Irish Times * ... an entertaining mix of good police work and desperate action as the young officer careers around Belfast, from one suspect to the next and back again, leaping to wrong conclusions but building his case... The tension makes for outstanding fiction. -- Jeff Glorfield * Melbourne Age/Sydney Morning Herald * Impressive... has a black humour reminiscent of Jacobean drama -- John Dugdale * Sunday Times * A cracking read, hugely entertaining and unrelentingly exciting * Sunday Herald Sun, Australia * Sizzles with ambient dread... Your reviewer was born the year The Cold, Cold Ground is set in, and such passages work better at painting a picture than any episode of Reeling In The Years... It&#39;s probably safe to say that Irish crime fiction&#39;s current purple patch won&#39;t be fading any time soon. * Sunday Independent (Ireland) * There is enough in McKinty&#39;s quirky and surprising style to make further Sean Duffy mysteries a prospect to be relished * Australian Financial Review * The Cold Cold Ground marks the emergence of an author who has the potential to become a major figure in the crime arena * Canberra Times, Australia * Witty, intelligent and teeming with broad cultural references and dazzling action set-pieces, this novel leaves you hungry for the next book in the triology * West Australian * Once again, McKinty proves himself a seriously brilliant novelist, his flair for language matched by his remarkable feel for place, well-known appetite for redemptive violence and seriously cool appreciation of characters who reject conformity. * The Australian *</p><h2>White: Whiteness And Race In Contemporary Art (Issues in Cultural Theory)</h2><p>Over the past 20 years, the cultural and scholarly discourse around race has exploded to include the study of whiteness and white privilege, representing a radical shift in the way we think and talk about race in the United States. Since the advent of the modern civil rights movement, people of color have usually been responsible for leading the debate and discussion about race and racism, forced to evaluate the status of their race in relation to the prejudice they experience every day--while most white people, even the most liberal, are usually oblivious to the psychological and political weight of their own color. The study of whiteness asks all Americans--and especially white people--to take stock of the political, psychological, economic and cultural implication of white skin, white entitlement and white privilege. <i>White: Whiteness and Race in Contemporary Art</i>, the first exhibition and book devoted to the subject, gives voice to 11 artists who explicitly address the issue of whiteness: Max Becher and Andrea Robbin, Nayland Blake, Nancy Burson, Wendy Ewald and Mike Kelley, William Kentridge, Barbara Kruger, Nikki S. Lee, Cindy Sherman and Gary Simmons. David R. Roediger, Professor of History and American Studies at the University of Minnesota, contributes an essay on whiteness in the culture at large, and Patricia J. Williams, Professor of Law at Columbia University, writes about the social and legal implications of whiteness.

The statistics are terrible: 436 acres of closely packed streets burned; 13,200 houses destroyed; �10 million lost at a time when �10 million represented the City?s annual income for 800 years.

She had been a warrior sister for three seasons now, a priestess of the Elk-dog Society. Admiring glances from young warriors of the band told her reassuringly that she made a fine appearance as she fulfilled the ceremonial function at the opening of the Warriors' Dance.Her white buckskin dress, with intricate quill work, was of the finest, reflecting her skills and those of her mother. Her glossy hair was parted and braided flawlessly, shining with blue-black highlights like the wing of a crow.It was said that her looks were much like those of her grandmother, Tall One, at the same age. The older woman, still handsome in her maturity, was said to have been the most beautiful of her generation. She was the wife of Heads Off, chief of the Southern band of the People, known as the Elk-dog band because of their skill with the horse.To that couple had been born two sons of distinction. The younger was now medicine man of the band, skilled in prediction, in healing, and, most of all, with the buffalo. Itwas said that of all medicine men in the entire tribe, none had stronger buffalo medicine than that of Owl.The elder son, called Eagle from his earliest days, was now a respected subchief, one of the most important leaders of his warrior society. That was, in fact, how his daughter had become a warrior sister.Eagle Woman enjoyed the ceremony, the pageantry, and the responsibility of the honored office. Besides, there were other advantages. She wished some day to marry and to raise strong warriors and capable women of the People. Yet there had been no suitor that came close to her ideals. A very independent girl, she had preferred competition with the young men rather than romance.As children in the Rabbit Society, both sexes received instruction in the use of weapons and in athletic skills. The young daughter of Eagle had been aggressive and talented in her learning. Soon the others were jokingly calling her by her father's name, adding the feminine "woman." As names sometimes do, the appellation stuck, and she became Eagle Woman. The girl gloried in the implication and pushed harder to perfect the warrior skills.Her masculine pursuits may have frightened away some suitors. Yet others seemed intrigued by her differences, and the persistence of one or two was becoming annoying. It was with some degree of relief, therefore, that Eagle Woman accepted the honor of becoming a warrior sister.This position required a vow of chastity, so in effect she could decently sidestep any unwanted proposals. Her reason was the best. Her office in a warrior society forbade such activity.There was only a slight gnawing of doubt in the back of her mind. Sometimes in the darkness, in the privacy of her own sleeping robes, Eagle Woman wondered. Was there something wrong with her? She had watched her contemporaries pair off in marriage until no woman her own age remained single. Even one of the other warrior sisters had resigned the honored office to marry.Now, at nearly nineteen summers, Eagle Woman was theoldest unmarried woman in the tribe. Basically, however, she was happy with her lot. Her demeanor radiated confidence and satisfaction, which may have only added to her beauty.Eagle Woman continued to step around the circle to the beat of the drum and the chant of the song, moving right to left with the other two warrior sisters. She passed her brother, Bobcat, seated at the edge of the arena, and he smiled proudly at her. He was two summers older, mischievous, and teasing, but he was obviously proud of his sister, her position of honor, and her well-recognized reputation for beauty.The girl did not return his smile but maintained the stolid dignity of the ceremony. Straight before her and stiffly upright stood the eagle feather in each hand, symbolic of far vision and courage.She passed others of her family as she circled. Her grandfather, the chief, sat with Tall One, both now showing the snow of many winters in their hair. The People had prospered under the leadership of Heads Off and the Elk-dog medicine he had brought from his far tribe. There were hardly people alive now who remembered a time before the horse. It was as if the Elk-dog had always been.Eagle Woman stepped past the point where her own parents were seated, acknowledging their presence with a glance. Eagle was seated with his left leg extended before him, rather than squatting or sitting cross-legged like most of the People. He had walked with a limp since before Eagle Woman could remember. There had been a stampede during a buffalo hunt, with the young warrior swept away by the frantic animals. Badly injured, he had been missing for six moons, given up for dead. There had been strange circumstances about his rediscovery, but she could not remember. Something to do with her uncle Owl, the medicine man.Suddenly Eagle Woman almost jumped, startled by the gaze of a young man at the circle's edge. She knew him well, had known him all her life. He was Long Walker, son of one of the chiefs of the Elk-dog band. The two childrenhad always been rivals. On the few occasions when Eagle Woman had been bested in athletic skills or proficiency with weapons, her opponent had been this young man. At times she had hated him for his ability. Always he was a relentless competitor, keen and quick, ready to laugh at her discomfiture in defeat.Now she read a new expression in the smiling face. His gaze was one of unabashed admiration. The girl was shocked, because she had never thought of him in this way. Long Walker was a rival, a competitor, not a potential romantic figure. She was irritated by his bold stare and shrugged him off with a toss of her raven braids. Outwardly she remained perfectly stoic, still wondering at this turn of events.She knew that Long Walker had no wife. That was a matter of some wonderment in the band, too. He was quite eligible. Though still living in his parents' lodge, he owned many horses in his own right. His lack of interest in marriage had led to whispered speculation as to whether he might choose to be a woman-man. Still, he had not yet started to cross-dress, and he had a good reputation in the hunt.Again Eagle Woman was irritated at herself for even wondering. What matter to her if some conceited young warrior wanted a wife or not? It was no concern of hers. She had better things to think about.Copyright � 1984 by Don Coldsmith</p><h2>True Escape Stories (True Adventure Stories)</h2><p>Collects eight stories of escapes from jail, prison, and military prison from around the world, most from the Second World War.</p><p></p><h2>The Diary of V: The Affair</h2><p>In her very wild diary, V tells all as she watches her husband stray into the arms of a younger woman. But payback - in the shape of a man - will be hers.</p><p>October 3 Worked late last night, trying to catch up on paperwork. It's just me, the Hungarian cleaning ladies, and the guy who waters the plants. I couldn't help but notice his arms, thick and hairy (nice hair, not gorilla man hair), and his torso is a perfect V. He is sex in a pair of blue jeans. <p>I realized that he was spending a lot of time around my desk, which didn't make sense since I only have one sad little ficus. Then he smiled and said, "Working late again, huh?" He was on one knee, tamping the mulch around the base of the tree. His fingers were thick and strong. "You ever find time for a little fun?" A legitimate question, actually. Since my promotion from staff therapist to "senior partner in wellness" here at the Westfield Center for Mental Wellness, I've had little time for anything but thrashing through heaps of paper and going to management meetings where I get to vote on such critical management questions as Does Filomena Perez in reception deserve a nineteen-dollar-a- week raise? (Yes.) Should our holiday staff party be catered or a potluck? (Catered. Who the hell has time to cook?) Should we start a softball team next spring? (God no.) As senior partner I was responsible for generating new "wellness bridges" to physicians, divorce attorneys, school counselors, and others who were in a position to send new clients our way. </p><p>"Nah, you don't get out much. I can tell." </p><p>Wait a minute. Was this guy trying to pick me up? </p><p>My whole body prickled to life. It had been two and a half months since Roger and I had sex, so it wouldn't take enormous effort to get me interested. His name was embroidered in neat cursive over his pocket. Eddie. "You have a cute mouth," he said. </p><p>Flirting! Oh joy! I straightened up and smiled at him. </p><p>I licked my lips. "Excuse me?" I said disingenuously. </p><p>He pointed to my computer. "Your mouse. Cute." </p><p>He was talking about the fuzzy mouse cover I'd bought at Staples. "Oh. Yes. My mouse." I was mortified. The man leaned across me to pet the mouse and I could feel the heat radiating off his forearm. "Well, I'd better get the rest of the floor," he said. Then he winked. </p><p>Roger was in his study when I got home. He didn't turn around when I walked into the room. It's been a week since I lightened my hair and he still hasn't no-ticed. I moved closer, bent to straighten some papers on his desk, flipped my hair in his direction. "Valerie, I'm working on a critical scene. Later, okay?" I would have slammed the door but my anger was suddenly tempered by simply this: Eddie. </p><p>'Til next time, V Copyright (c) 2001 by Women.com LLC</p>Installments of The Diary of V, which began as a Redbook Web site serial in 1997, are joined and expanded in this funny but frantic new novel. Midwestern college town therapist Valerie Tisdale is a journal-keeping everywoman brimming with appetite, energy and a hapless bent toward self-destruction. When she meets Eddie, owner of the plant company that services her office ficus, his sexy presence unleashes longings that V's husband Roger won't fulfill and aggravates V's growing discontent with her marriage which is already threatened by signs that her chilly spouse has been unfaithful. Troubles also brew at work, where a colleague threatens to expose V's liaison, a power-hungry new partner angles for her job and an armload of nutty clients act out with abandon. The book leaves her jobless and spouseless, but with two sequels already in the works, it's clear V's problems are far from over. Kent, a frequent contributor to national women's magazines, propels her heroine from crisis to crisis as relentlessly as any Victorian melodrama, and, in the end, there's little that's truly fresh in this middle-aged Bridget Jones knockoff. Still, V's honesty about everything from stretch marks to extramarital sex makes her an amusing companion, and busy soccer moms will appreciate the brevity of the story segments.

Symptoms include refusal to doubt or question authority, judgmental attitudes, eating disorders, using fear, shame, or guilt to control others, and eventual emotional isolation. Booth explores the background of religious addiction, comparing the addict's progress with the stages of alcoholism and citing case histories that demonstrate the consequences of religious addiction on family members, especially children, victims of the addict's religious abuse. Booth recommends counseling and outlines a self-help program for developing a healthy spirituality, using affirmations and exercises based on a rewritten version of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Appendixes give guidelines for intervention and professional treatment.

It was a bold and determined endeavor, especially since there were very few female lighthouse keepers in the country at that time. For 43 years, until the age of 80, Harriet kept her light burning, through storms, harsh winters, and changes in technology. This true story focuses on Harriet&#39;s commitment and determination to fulfilling her charge and living life on her own terms. Excerpts from her actual log are included.</p><p>Women have been holding their own in a man s world since the beginning of time, and the story of hard-working, diminutive Miss Harriet Colfax who kept the Michigan City Lighthouse going for 43 years is proof of this.<br>In Miss Colfax s Light, by attorney, teacher, and author Aimee Bissonette, 37-year-old Harriet Colfax follows her brother to Indiana to start a newspaper, but when he gets sick and moves away, she has no money, no job and nowhere to live. She decides to take a job as a lighthouse keeper because it does more than pay a good salary ($350 a year a whopping amount back then), it also gives her a place to live.<br>For the next 43 years, Harriet cleans, paints, varnishes wood, carries buckets of whale oil up and down stairs to light the tower lantern, and keeps copious notes in the lighthouse log. She braves raging winds and biting cold, and she even experiences brushes with death when the city builds a long catwalk that stretches 1500 feet out across the lake and places a lamp at the end of it, because it s Harriet s job to keep that lamp lit, even if it means getting swept off of the catwalk in the process. When yet another light is added on the other side of the lake, Harriet has to take oars in hand and row herself across to keep it lit. And though the Lighthouse Inspector often refuses to send help, Harriet somehow manages to keep the light going for all the sailors and seamen who may need it to guide them home.<br>Miss Colfax s Light definitely has that wow factor. The thought of this tiny woman braving hard work and solitude from age 37 until she finally retired at age 80 is something to admire. According to an Author s Note in back of the book, In all her years of service, Harriet s Michigan City lights never failed to shine. In fact, Harriet was so faithful in her service that ship captains called her lighthouse Old Faithful. <br>Ms. Bissonette s prose is lyrical and sweet, and easily whisks readers back to the simple and rustic America of yesteryear that history buffs love reading about. The book is packed to the rim with details that may have seemed mundane had another writer tackled such a subject; after all, cooking, cleaning, painting and toting buckets full of liquid are not the most exciting things in the world, and yet Ms. Bissonette manages to keep readers thoroughly engaged and cheering Miss Colfax s every accomplishment.<br>Eileen Ryan Ewen s illustrations are the icing on the cake for this book. The scenes center around a dark, turbulent ocean, and most of the pictures include raging winds, billowing clouds, tossing boats or ships, and the ever-vigilant Miss Colfax tending to her light.<br>This book is perfect for Women s History Month, an American History classroom, a discussion on various occupations, or as an example of the true meaning of the word commitment. Indeed, if a reader looks up the word commitment in the dictionary and happens to see Miss Colfax s work-worn but determined face beside the word, it wouldn t be a surprise at all. --Picture Book Depot<br><br>Miss Colfax s Light written by Aimee Bissonette and illustrated by Eileen Ryan Ewen is a true story about Harriet Colfax s remarkable tenure as the lighthouse keeper at The Michigan City Lighthouse in Michigan City, Indiana.<br>She applied for the position in 1861 when she was 37 years old after her brother fell ill and closed his newspaper where she had been working. This left her with no way to support herself. When the appointment came through Harriet and life-long friend Ann Hartwell moved into the lighthouse and made it their home. Many thought Harriet would not be able to do the job because of her slight physical build and inexperience, but she proved them wrong as she kept her light on consistently for forty-three years until she retired in 1904 at the age of 80!<br>This great physical feat was bolstered by Harriet s mantra, I can do this. She quickly learned to tend the light twice each night by climbing the narrow stairway to the top of the lantern tower with a bucket of whale oil in hand.<br>In 1871 a beacon light was installed on the East Pier. This required Harriet to walk a catwalk over the pier extending 1500 feet out into the water to bring a bucket of lard oil to that light. It was very dangerous.<br>Eileen Ryan Ewen s marvelous illustrations are alive with wind, rain, waves, hail and sometimes snow as Harriet is pictured trying to reach the beacon light. The very dramatic picture of Harriet fighting the swirling elements just before the beacon light is ripped from its moorings is visually very effective.<br>An informative Author s Note, Harriet s journal entries and a Glossary of Lighthouse Terms are very helpful to the story.<br>Miss Colfax s Light written by Aimee Bissonette and illustrated by Eileen Ryan Ewen, is perfect for readers 6-9 years of age --The Children's Bookshelf<br><br>"[...] This wonderful nonfiction book tells the story of an extraordinary woman who took on a very difficult job, and who performed that job, often under very difficult circumstances, for many decades. Throughout the book beautiful artwork is paired with a carefully crafted text to give readers an engaging tale that takes us back in time." - Through the Looking Glass (Marya Jansen-Gruber)<br>"[...] In Miss Colfax s Light, Aim�e Bissonette and illustrator Eileen Ryan Ewen celebrate Harriet Colfax s life. In frugal, vivid prose, Bissonette conveys both nineteenth century constraints on women s choices and Colfax s determination to succeed in a man s world. Excerpts from Colfax s log appear in several spreads, further illuminating the harsh weather and constant toil that formed her days. Ewen s illustrations evoke both the coziness of the lighthouse and the exhausting nature of the work. Readers see for themselves just how backbreaking the work was and why Colfax embraced this existence. An author s note provides additional information about Colfax and includes a glossary of lighthouse terms.<br>Miss Colfax s Light is a winning picture-book biography of an unconventional Victorian woman. It is also a look at a vanished way of life and a testament to the satisfaction of a job well done." - Kidbiographer's blog --Editorial ReviewsK-Gr 3&#x2014;From 1861 to 1904, Miss Harriet Colfax tended the oil lamps and beacons of the Michigan City Lighthouse while living in the keeper's house on the Lake Michigan shore with her friend and companion, Ann Hartwell. Harriet's story begins in pictures, with a verso spread showing her traveling by boat to the lighthouse with all her possessions. Ewen's illustrations, which appear to be watercolors with fine-lined detail, add excitement to this story, helping readers imagine the subject's difficult life. The artist varies their size and shape, using vignettes to show the tedium of daily chores and, at one point, using a dramatic cutaway of the keeper's house to emphasize the challenge of the twice-nightly climb to the light. There are striking storms and angry waves. Bissonette dramatizes Harriet's story with events the keeper had noted in her journal and with reiterations of her determination ("I can do this."). Quotes from the journal are set off in parchment-colored boxes, but the back matter (a short author's note and glossary) does not include sources. VERDICT Though not as dramatic as Marissa Moss's The Bravest Woman in America, about Ida Lewis, this is an appealing profile of a remarkable woman and a nice reminder that the Great Lakes have dangerous coasts as well.&#x2014;Kathleen Isaacs, Children's Literature Specialist, Pasadena, MD</p><h2>From Here to Enlightenment: An Introduction to Tsong-kha-pa&#39;s Classic Text The Great Treatise of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</h2><p><b>The most extensive teaching given by the Dalai Lama in the West on a seminal Tibetan Buddhist text.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Dalai Lama was forced to go into exile in 1959, his copy of Tsong-kha-pa's classic text <i>The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment </i>was one of the few items that he could take with him.

Indeed I am very, very happy to be here to lecture on the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim chen mo).1 I visited the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s center during my first visit to America in 1979 because, especially since the time of the Third Dalai Lama, there have long been very close links between Tibetans and Mongolians.2 Tibetans have a unique and very close relationship with Mongolians, including the Kalmyks and Buryats. In my own case, one of my best study partners was Ngodrup Tsokyi, a Mongolian. He helped me so much, so I feel a very close, personal connection. One time when I visited the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s center, we reflected on the many stories of our strong connections in the past. Everyone was deeply moved and we were all in tears together. <br>Joshua Cutler, Director of the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center, is neither Tibetan nor Mongolian; he is European American. But I do think Joshua and Diana have very faithfully carried on the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s spirit. They asked me to teach the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment and they translated it into English. I promised that in the future I would teach this text. Today, that is realized. <br>But of course this book is quite thick. Reading it all in a few days is impossible. So I will teach primarily by summarizing its essential points, elaborating as necessary. <br>The Great Treatise was written by Lama Tsong-kha-pa, a great scholar, a real holder of the Nalanda tradition.3 I think he is one of the very best Tibetan scholars. Although it is now widely available in Tibetan as well as English, you see that I brought with me today my own personal copy of this text. On March 17th, 1959, when I left Norbulingka that night, I brought this book with me.4 Since then, I have used it ten or fifteen times to give teachings, all from this copy. So this is something very dear to me. <br><b>Global Responsibility </b><br>Most of you are familiar with my commitments, my views and thoughts. But perhaps some of you are new, so I want to mention briefly my basic commitments. In the first place, I am just one human being among six billion. The fact is that all six billion human beings share one planet. We all survive under one sun. Today, especially, we are simply one community in the face of population growth, instantaneous communication, the modern global economy, and our common environmental problems. We are really one entity. In reality, there is no separate, independent, individual interest. For each of us, the future is entirely dependent on the rest of humanity, the rest of the world. But our ways of thinking about things are still based on concepts inherited from ancient times when each community lived more or less independently. There is a growing gap between our perceptions and reality. Our outdated way of thinking gives us the mistaken view that we&#x2013;&#x2013;and our communities&#x2013;&#x2013; are separate from the rest of the world. Based on that, our actions are unrealistic. <br>Nobody wants more problems. Nonetheless, there are many problems and many of them we create for ourselves because we lack a holistic, realistic view. In order to develop a sense of global responsibility, we have to look at the entire planet. It is just one small planet and our individual futures entirely depend upon it. We must take care of it. The only way to safeguard our futures as individuals is to develop a sense of concern for the well-being of all other people, all of the other living beings in the world. <br>So my primary commitment is to make it clear that we need a sense of global responsibility. In this regard, I consider Buddhist teachings not as a religion, but simply as some ideas that may be helpful. It is useful, for example, to consider all living beings. Maybe it seems unrealistic to think about other beings in other worlds. Whether you think it makes sense or not, emotionally it is very useful. When we have been practicing extending our concern to an infinite number of beings on an infinite number of planets, then of course there is no question that we would want to care for six billion human beings right here on this planet. And billions of animals&#x2014;they really suffer immensely at human hands, don&#x2019;t they? So the Buddhist message of infinite altruism is very relevant. It is not about our future lifetimes or becoming enlightened. It is simply that infinite altruism is very useful for becoming a happier person, a sensible and useful person on this planet.5 <br>In day-to-day life, whenever we are facing difficulty, some of these Buddhist ideas can be really helpful. They equip our minds, particularly our emotions, so that we can maintain peace of mind when we are facing difficulty. This is good for our health. Too many worries and too much ambition are bound to increase suspicion and jealousy, leading to even more mental disturbance. Some of these Buddhist ideas can be very helpful to the well-being of individuals, mentally and emotionally. And in dependence upon that, they have physical benefits as well. So if you are a nonbeliever who has no interest in religion, fine. Listen to some of these ideas and if you hear something that seems useful, then take it. If you it feel that is nonsense, then just forget it. <br><b>Religious Harmony </b><br>My second commitment is to promote religious harmony. I am a Buddhist; sometimes I am considered a staunch Buddhist. Those ancient Indian Buddhist masters, particularly the scholars of Nalanda University, had very, very critical minds. 6 They analyzed everything, both the Buddha&#x2019;s own words and the views of non-Buddhist traditions. Buddhist masters like Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Dignaga, Dharmakirti, and Shantarakshita were very sharp logicians who were able to find every crack, every weakness, in non-Buddhist philosophical positions. I am like this, at least to some degree. I want to investigate, to analyze, and in that sense I can say that I am a very staunch Buddhist. <br>At the same time, I also accept the value or potential of all of the major traditions. It is so terrible, so sad, that there is conflict in the name of religion. Innocent, genuine, faithful people suffer as a result. So it is essential to make an effort to promote religious harmony within a sense of respect and mutual understanding. It helps for non-Buddhists to understand something about the structure of Buddhism and for Buddhists to understand other religions. <br>This is why, yesterday, I went on pilgrimage in Rajasthan to the Ajmer Sharif shrine, a famous Muslim holy place.7 It is perhaps the holiest place of Sufi Islam. Each year, prayers are offered for six days to commemorate the death of a great saint. They invited me. They prayed all night, but I preferred to participate in the early morning. So yesterday from 2:30 to 4:30 A.M. I prayed while wearing a Muslim hat&#x2014;a Buddhist monk&#x2019;s robe and a Muslim hat.8 There seemed to be several hundred thousand people and it was incredibly hot and humid. Of course, with so many people packed in a small area, there was sweat and odor. Maybe we can call it the scent of ethical discipline&#x2014;mixed, of course, with sweat! My robes are still damp right now. I really enjoyed this; it was wonderful. <br>A few weeks earlier there was an international Muslim conference in Delhi. They invited me and I think I was the only non-Muslim participating. That afternoon, I visited the Jamma Masjid in Delhi and prayed together with thousands and thousands of Muslims.9 That was the first time I wore the Muslim white cap. Personally, this made me very happy, conservative elements might feel differently about my doing this. But the response from the mainstream community was excellent. It seems that people appreciated my efforts to promote inter-religious harmony and genuine respect across the traditions. <br>If you also think that this issue of understanding and harmony across the world religions is important, then please take action. Make closer contacts with the followers of other traditions. Since the September 11th event, it is extremely important to reach out to Muslim brothers and sisters, to make contact with them. Many people have a negative impression of Muslims and that is totally wrong. <br>Of course, in the past, many Indian Buddhists did suffer a great deal at the hands of Muslims, but the past is gone.10 It is useless to dwell on this and to hold on to hatred. It is absolutely foolish. Today, for example, there are many Muslims living in the Bodhgaya area. I think that perhaps their ancestors came to Bodhgaya in order to destroy the Buddhist temple there.11 But now they are the best friends of Buddhist pilgrims. Whenever I visit Bodhgaya they welcome me with tea and some very delicious nuts. I always enjoy that. That is the reality today. <br><b>China and Tibet </b><br>My third commitment is to the cause of Tibet and its people and cul&#xffad;&#xffad;ans and Chinese, it&#x2019;s my moral responsibility to speak for Tibetans. Unfortunately, since the crisis of March 10, 2008, Chinese government propaganda has given many Chinese the sense that Tibetans are anti�Chinese.12 Feelings were running high. During my last visit to America, some Chinese were demonstrating where I was speaking, so I wanted to meet some of them. I did meet seven of them. Two of them calmly listened to my explanations, but the rest were very angry and had no interest in listening. The emotions involved are just too strong. <br>I suggested that now is a perfect time to set up friendship groups communities. They should get to know each other so that when a problem arises, they can discuss it, exchanging information and perspective. Without this, there is usually no communication between these groups. They remain isolated and then, when there is an incident, emotions overwhelm them. <br>You can help. In any community where there are some Tibetans and some Han Chinese, help them to create a common friendship group. You can join as well, as long as you have some sincere motivation. But in the end, the Tibetan problem has to be solved between the Han Chinese and the Tibetans. No one else can do this for us. <br>We Tibetans extend our right hand to our Han Chinese friends and our left hand to our Western supporters. Of the two hands, the right hand is considered more important. We extend this hand to the Chinese government. But as long as this right hand remains empty, our left hand accepts help from other people who are really concerned for us. It is only logical and natural. When the right hand gets some concrete result, then the left hand will withdraw and wave goodbye. <br>It is extremely important that our Han Chinese brothers and sisters have full awareness of the Tibetan problem. It is helpful to take every opportunity to tell them about Tibetan culture, Tibetan language, or Tibetan spirituality. Then there will be a chance to say something about history, considering Tibetan views and Chinese views. Among the Chinese, there are different views about history; not everyone accepts the official version. We need a realistic approach and in order to have that, we need fuller knowledge about reality. Maybe some of you can help in this way. <br><b>Junior Students in the Dharma </b><br>According to the conventional understanding of history, the Buddha came to the world almost twenty-six hundred years ago. Eventually the teachings of the Buddha spread from India to different regions, including Southeast Asia and East Asia. Today, Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, and so forth mainly follow the Pali tradition. In China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam&#x2014;as well as Tibet and Mongolia&#x2014;the Pali tradition is present, but there is also the Sanskrit tradition.13 For understanding Buddhism in the Sanskrit tradition, Chinese language is most important, followed by Tibetan. Buddhism flourished in China at least three or four centuries earlier than in Tibet. <br>I consider the Pali tradition to be the most senior; it is the foundation of the Buddha Dharma. Those who hold this tradition are the most senior students of the Buddha. Then, within the Sanskrit tradition, the Chinese Buddhists are the most senior Buddhists. We, the Tibetans and Mongolians, rank after that. So, whenever I give a teaching to the Chinese community, I always begin by expressing my respect to them as elder students of the Buddha. <br>At the same time, I might mention that as far as knowledge is concerned, junior students are sometimes better. Tibetan Buddhism was established by Shantarakshita, one of the very best logicians and philosophers of the Nalanda tradition. He personally came to Tibet. He and his student Kamalashila were both great scholars and their writings are still available. They were great logicians, Madhyamika philosophers and monks; naturally they wanted their students, the Tibetans, also to be like that. Even now, in the twenty-first century, we study important texts in a rigorous way. First, we memorize them and then get a word-by-word explanation. After that, we debate their meaning in a thorough and highly precise way. Tibetans in general have knowledge of the Buddha Dharma simply because of these great teachers; through them, we became real holders of the Nalanda tradition. So, in terms of having a deeper and more complete form of the teaching, I do think the Tibetan tradition is the best. <br>Between texts written by Indian masters and texts written by Tibetan masters, different circumstances led to different styles. India was not just Buddhist; there were many non-Buddhists and there were extensive discussions among the best scholars of the different traditions. So Indian masters like Nagarjuna and Aryadeva wrote texts that take a more comparative perspective and engage in deeper analysis. The Tibetan masters, on the other hand, took for granted that their audience was entirely Buddhist, so they do little comparison. <br><b>Reality Is neither Buddhist nor Christian </b><br>On this planet there are many different religious traditions; each started in a different area and each is suitable to the peoples of that region.<br>For more than one thousand years, and in some cases for more than two thousand years, these traditions have truly served humanity. Today, many millions of people get inspiration from these traditions. It is a fact. And in the future these major traditions will remain, serving humanity. <br>Sometimes in the past, the existence of many different religious traditions caused problems. From now on, I hope we will have fewer such problems because of a greater sense of closeness. We understand more about the value of other traditions. Just as there are many different kinds of people, there are different traditions that suit them. Generally speaking, in the West, Christianity is dominant; the culture has a Jewish and Christian heritage. It is often safer and better to keep to your own religious tradition. <br>To illustrate this, let me relate some things that I have personally observed. There was a Polish woman who was a Theosophist&#x2014;I met her long ago at the Madras Theosophical Society.14 After 1959, when a great many Tibetans came to India, she became very close with Tibetans and she helped many young Tibetan students with their education. As a result of this connection, she came to accept Buddhism as her own religion. But later, when she was more than eighty years old and approaching death, the conce...</p><h2>Titanicus</h2><p>When the vital forge world of Orestes comes under attack by a legion of Chaos Titans, the planet is forced to appeal for help.

Mr. Silverberg's Majipoor Cycle, set on perhaps the grandest and greatest world ever imagined, is considered one of the jewels in the crown of speculative fiction.<p></p>The first installment of Silverberg&#39;s celebrated Majipoor Cycle makes for relaxing listening. In an unhurried bass voice, Stefan Rudnicki calmly escorts the listener through the expansively descriptive world of Majipoor, an ancient and fantastical kingdom which, having forgotten conflict, is, nonetheless, on the brink of civil war. Particularly difficult vocal challenges include a bureaucratic two-headed alien, who is achieved though vocal skill rather than special effects. Although Rudnicki ably performs a myriad of characters, most notably the whimsical Lord Valentine, his expressive voice resonates better in prose than in his brief performances of the romantic love interest&#39;s singing.

Joseph&#39;s grandfather made him a beautiful blanket when he was a baby, but now it&#39;s frazzled and worn, and Joseph&#39;s mother says it is time to throw it out. Joseph doesn&#39;t want to part with his special blanket, and he&#39;s sure that his grandfather can fix it. Sure enough, Grandfather miraculously alters the blanket into useful items again and again. But when Joseph loses the final item, even Grandfather can&#39;t make something from nothing. But maybe Joseph can? Based on the Yiddish folktale &#34;Joseph&#39;s overcoat,&#34; Phoebe Gilman&#39;s gorgeous artwork charts the transformation of the blanket and the progress of Joseph&#39;s family through the years, subtly teaching young readers about a lost way of life.</p><p><b>Pheobe Gilman</b> was the beloved creator of the <i>Jillian Jiggs</i> series as well as the award-winning <i>Something From Nothing</i>, <i>The Gypsy Princess</i>, <i>Pirate Pearl</i>, <i>Little Blue Ben</i>, <i>The Balloon Tree</i>, and <i>Grandma and the Pirates</i>. She passed away in 2002.PreSchool-Grade 3-This tale drawn from Jewish folklore has been told in many variations, but never so richly. It is a story of relationships, trust, transformations, and optimism, as well as being an entree to Jewish history in Eastern Europe of the 19th-20th century. Grandpa trims away the worn parts of Joseph's baby blanket and uses it to make him a jacket in the first of its many transformations into ever smaller items: a vest, a tie, a handkerchief, and a button as each item in turn becomes worn. When the button is lost, Joseph declares: "'There is just enough material here to make...a wonderful story!'" The story is told with repetitive, rhythmic phrases that children will soon anticipate and join in on. Using colored pencils, watercolors, and possibly other media, Gilman has created a shtetl in a book. Each oversized wood-framed page draws readers closely into the town or into Joseph's house and also below its floor where the mice use each discarded scrap to furnish their own snug home. Shades of warm brown, rust, and gold, accented with bright blue, lend a feeling of nostalgia. Gilman's art is subtle with painterly shading, a skillful use of light and dark, and expressive line. Each page is beautifully composed. While some of the folk characters' expressions are exaggerated, this is, after all, supposed to be funny.<br><i> Marcia Posner, Federation of New York and the Jewish Book Council, New York City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ryokan: Zen Monk - Poet of Japan</h2><p>Ryokan (1758-1831), a Buddhist monk in the Zen sect, was a major figure in Tokugawa poetry.

The day-to-day struggles of such a monumental undertaking included challenges such as the selection and preparation of more than 250 calf skins, as well as forming a team of calligraphers accustomed to working independently and communicating the concerns of the advisory council in Minnesota with the artists in Wales. Illuminating the Word: The Making of The Saint John?s Bible explores a modern version of an age-old relationship between patron and sponsor, and the artistic director, scribes and artists producing this monumental artwork. It describes lectio divina, the unique method the Benedictine monks use to read the Bible, in which the Holy Scriptures come alive through the power of imagination. It explores the challenge of creating new images for ancient stories. It chronicles the artistic techniques, the tools and materials and workshop practices Donald Jackson used to create his lifetime masterpiece. Illuminating the Word reveals the working process behind one of the greatest undertakings of our time and vividly brings to life its challenges and triumphs.? . . . the appearance of the book is worthy of its magnificent subject matter.? Anglican Theological Review?The jacket is beautifully designed encasing a rich blue heavyweight buckram binding. The page designs are excellent and the rich coated paper stock provides a wonderful pallet for the type and four-color photographs that are found on every page.? The Catholic Press Association?An excellent record of the process itself. Anybody who wants to know what it is like to actually reproduce a handwritten Bible will surely want to read this book.? The American Benedictine Review?Calderhead takes you into the details in a way that you almost feel you are there. Sometimes we almost feel we are getting under Jackson?s feet, but it is worth his wrath to see what is going on.? The American Benedictine Review?This is truly visio divina, a visual meditation on the Word of God.? Prairie Messenger ?In the 10 chapters of his conversational accounting of the planning and ongoing progress of publishing The Saint John?s Bible, Calderhead takes his readers into the lives and skills of the monks, and of the scribal and artistic experts employed in the project.? Prairie Messenger?The calligraphy, gold gilding, and full-color illustrations ignite the religious imagination, inviting people to explore a living tradition of art and spirituality.? The Faith Connection??a fascinating account not only of the practicalities of the making of the Saint John?s Bible, but also of the vision and values of the communities of monks and artists that collaborated to produce the work in Collegeville and in Wales.? Catholic Library World?A delightful coffee-table book.? The Bible Today?How fortunate for the public that both Benedictine institutions also commissioned Christopher Calderhead to tell the story involved in The Making of the St. John?s Bible.? Prairie Messenger&#34;The St. John&#39;s Bible is unquestionably art. And in the practice of Jackson and his team members, so is calligraphy.&#34; Journal Star Lincoln, Nebraska&#34;Here, with proper care from the monks, the St. John&#39;s Bible could conceivably last two thousand years, long after most of today&#39;s printed books have turned to dust, leaving a legacy of Christianity in the 21st century and of the Benedictines who commissioned it.&#34;Today&#39;s CatholicChristopher Calderhead is a visual artist and graphic designer who has exhibited his letter-based works in the United States and Great Britain.

Tradition states that on this journey he was accompanied by none other than Jesus, who at this stage was a young boy. This title reveals the events of St Joseph&#39;s time at Glastonbury, and explores the legend behind this intriguing story. Britain is proverbially rich in monuments of the past, but of all the ancient places with outward and visible links with antiquity this little Somerset town is unique. For it is not only bestowed with visible evidences, wrought in stone, of generations long departed, but it is also steeped in fascinating legend and tradition. One of these later traditions states that Glastonbury was the very cradle of English Christianity, where an infant church was planted by those who personally knew Jesus. This is a truly fascinating and innovative perspective on the story of St Joesph of Arimathea, which promises to enthrall the reader.</p><p></p><h2>A Year in the Garden: 365 Inspirational Gardens and Gardening Tips</h2><p><b>Whether you're planting your first flowers or perfecting your master garden, this luminous daybook takes you around the world of gardens for a daily dose of inspiration.</b><br><br>Anyone who loves their garden knows that there's something happening in nature every day of the year.

James, comfortably settled in London, found in Wharton's company the sustained intimacy which his circle of young, attractive men could not provide. To Wharton, James was "Dearest Cher Maitre," supportive confidant during her frenetic extramarital fling with his longtime friend William Morton Fullerton. The James-Wharton meeting of minds had "a piquant touch of the erotic," as Powers (editor, with Leon Edel, of James's notebooks) observes; James nicknamed her automobile "The Vehicle of Passion." Later, he became an almost avuncular comrade. Wharton, unbeknownst to him, diverted her own Scribner royalties so that James received from the publisher the largest advance of his career. Nearly all of the surviving letters are by James, but we get an exchange as complex, rich and varied as the correspondents' fiction. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Editor Powers has gathered all the surviving correspondence between the two novelists, which reveals how these mutual admirers became devoted friends near the end of James's life. Sadly, very few letters survive from Wharton's side, but she's still a strong presence here as James admires her travels and projects, his awe alternating with delicious irony. Though full of references to her failing marriage and his failing health and hopes, his letters are buoyed up by an unfailingly playful wit. Most of them have not appeared before, and few with such helpful clarifications (Powers even footnotes the French phrases sprinkled throughout).

They also have many of the same drawbacks, such as poor depiction of relative size in the photos and topics that are too broad to be covered in one volume. Africa is populated by so many groups that they can't all be addressed in depth here. The book's organization results in a lack of continuity as it moves through discussions of social life and customs with minimal references to place and group names. This problem is compounded by the fact that much of the information is given in broad generalities. Only one small map of the continent is provided, and readers may find it dizzying going back and forth to figure out where they are. Similar problems occur in Gorilla, which is really about primates. This volume does a better job of presenting its topic, however, by focusing on one group or type of primate at a time. Determining the relative size of these mammals is not possible on many of the pages, although in some instances weight and height figures are given.

Through extensive participant observation and open-ended interviews, <i>Transmen and FTMs</i> allows female-to-male transsexuals to speak for themselves and reveal aspects of female gender diversity that do not fit into the ready-made categories of male and female.<br> &nbsp;<br> In clarifying how transmen and FTMs define and validate their lives, as opposed to how society attempts to pigeonhole and belittle them, Cromwell shows how female-to-male transpeople have been made virtually invisible by male-dominated discourses. He considers cross-cultural data on female gender diversity, historical evidence of female-bodied people who have lived as men, and contemporary transmen and FTMs. He also addresses how FTMs and transmen are working to challenge the mental illness model of transness as well as other misconceptions.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Transmen and FTMs</i> seeks to reframe the dialogue about gender identity and move away from regarding fixed gender categories as normative.

What gives her the most pleasure? Where should you be touching her - and how? Fortunately, there are some people who can offer men the empirical knowledge gained from a lifetime of pleasing women - and getting pleased by them. This frank, frolicsome, and wonderfully illuminating book draws on the sexual advice and sex secrets of lesbians to help men become better lovers. A groundbreaking dialogue between straight men and gay women, and an erotic look inside the often hidden world of lesbian sex, <b>Lesbian Sex Secrets for Men</b> reveals a whole new approach to pleasure for men and the women they love. At the same time, this book proves that while sex is something we all do naturally, a little focused effort - and a few simple lessons - can open up a whole new world of enjoyment.</p><p>The aim of <i>Lesbian Sex Secrets for Men</i> is to teach men what lesbians know about pleasing women. This is more than a primer on body parts and oral sex (though yes, there's plenty of that). It's also about how to talk (the best way to find out what your partner likes), how to listen, how to open up, and how to get your mind off your member. The chapter entitled "Foreplay? Honey, It's All Play!" should make women cheer. The writing is clever, graphic, intimate, and festive. No subject is off limits: sex toys, sex during menstruation ("When the Moon Is Between Her Legs"), "Finger Love (Becoming a Digital Master)," "The Lowdown on Going Down," anal play ("Ass-istance for Two"), and much more.<p> In many short quotes, women frankly discuss their likes and dislikes. Notes of special importance, titled "Honey, Come Closer," include: </p><ul><li>"Quit thinking of the clitoris as a little pea-sized bump.... It is actually a whole system of erectile tissue, spongy tissue, muscles, nerve endings, blood vessels, and glands."<br> </li><li>"By taking your time, not only do you create steamy anticipation in your partner; you also get to check out the territory and get a good sense of where everything is so there is no clumsy fumbling."<br> </li><li>"A steady hand is worth a thousand orgasms."<br></li></ul> If men understood what great sexual tools their brains, mouths, and hands were, say the authors, they'd see sex and pleasure differently and communicate in new ways. This book is guidebook and roadmap--and very entertaining besides! (Warning: If you're offended by slang terms for sex and sexual parts, this book isn't for you.) <i>--Joan Price</i><b>Amy Jo Goddard</b> earned her Master's degree in Human Sexuality Education from New York University and has 20 years of experience in the sexuality field.

The author, archaeologist Chris Scarre, examines the haunting cave paintings of Lascaux, France; the stone circle and ritual complexes of Avebury, England; and the ever mysterious Stonehenge--as well as lesser known but no less intriguing sites around Europe. For each location, he conducts a careful tour of the existing remains, describes the history of its excavation, and then interprets how the site might have been built, used, or occupied. Readers will explore a variety of cultures and monuments, from megalithic stone circles to Neolithic villages to Bronze Age tombs, and see intimate portraits of the daily life of Europe's prehistoric ancestors. Perhaps equally important, Scarre has selected the sites with accessibility in mind--all can be easily reached by the modern tourist--and he also highlights local museums and visitor centers where further artifacts and information can be found.<br> Beautifully illustrated with maps and full-color photographs, <em>Exploring Prehistoric Europe</em> makes the perfect companion for the historically minded traveler--or the reader who wants to curl up at home and wander at leisure through the distant past.</p><p>British archaeologist Chris Scarre provides a literate and thoroughly enjoyable grand tour of Old World prehistory in this handsomely illustrated volume, the first in Oxford's "Places in Time" series. Treating 15 sites as case studies, Scarre grounds his readers in some of the thornier problems confronting archaeologists: establishing reliable chronologies (and Scarre, like many of his colleagues, proposes extending the arrival of humans to the European continent much farther back in time than late-20th-century orthodoxy permits), determining the ways of life of prehistoric peoples, and, most difficult of all, guessing at what they might have thought and believed about the world and their place in it.<p> Scarre takes us to expected venues such as Stonehenge and Maiden Castle, and he conducts a chamber-by-chamber tour of Lascaux Cave, which the French government closed to the public years ago. He also ventures to a number of lesser-known sites that are in many ways more illuminating of European prehistory than are their more famous counterparts. Tarxien, a Maltese site, for instance, yields evidence of organized religion dating far back into the megalithic period; its peculiar temple architecture gives "an impression of dramatic ritual ceremonies in a setting carefully designed with an eye to effect." Scarre aims to educate the eye of the traveler to recognize signs of the prehistoric presence in a landscape since overlain by many other cultures. In this he is eminently successful. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Chris Scarre</strong> is Deputy Director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge.

Classic French, Italian and American ices are represented as well as those from Asia and the Middle East. The recipes cater for both adult and children&#39;s tastes. All are suitable for making with or without an ice-cream making machine. Every recipe is detailed and has been thoroughly tested. All measures are given in the US, imperial and metric.</p><p>Breathes there a person with tastebuds so dead that ice cream poses absolutely no temptation? Not in America, certainly, and definitely not in the U.K., where food writer Liddell and manufacturer Weir have collaborated to share both recipes and information. Their research uncovers the fact that Marco Polo <i>didn't</i> find the Chinese creating this cold treat and that "Aquataq" is an Eskimo ice cream (not to be confused with Eskimo Pie). Other data tend toward the useful: a glossary, an examination of ingredients, the chemistry of ices, the tasting of ice cream, and equipment. Despite the Briticisms and occasional references to foodstuffs virtually non-existent in the U.S., the more than 200 recipes just might sate sweet cravings or satisfy the gotta-do-something-different gourmand. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>A Distant Center</h2><p>In the bold tradition of the &#x201c;Misty Poets,&#x201d; Ha Jin confronts China&#x2019;s fraught political history while paying tribute to its rich culture and landscape. The poems of A Distant Center speak in a voice that is steady and direct, balancing contemplative longing with sober warnings from a writer who has confronted the traumas of censorship and state violence. With unadorned language and epigrammatic wit, Jin conjures scenes that encompass the personal, historical, romantic, and environmental, interrogating conceptions of foreignness and national identity as they appear and seep into everyday interactions and being. These are poems that offer solace in times of political reaction and uncertainty. Jin&#x2019;s voice is wise, comforting, and imploring; his words are necessary and his lessons are invaluable. Question your place in the world&#x2015;do not be complacent&#x2015;look for strength and hope in every nook: &#x201c;Keep in mind the meaning of / your existence: wherever you land, / your footprints will become milestones.&#x201d;</p><p>Ha Jin was born in Liaoning Province, China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution of the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s while serving in the People&#x2019;s Liberation Army.

Electing to remain in the U.S. after the massacre of students at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Jin has since published eight novels, four short story collections, three poetry collections, and a book of essays on the language and literature of migration. He has twice received the PEN/Faulkner Award, for War Trash (2004) and for Waiting (1999), which also won the National Book Award.

Drawing inspiration from six of the finest minds in history - Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche - he addresses lack of money, the pain of love, inadequacy, anxiety and conformity. De Botton&#39;s book led one critic to call philosophy &#39;the new rock and roll&#39;.</p><p>"It is common," Alain de Botton writes in <i>The Consolations of Philosophy</i>, "to assume that we are dealing with a highly intelligent book when we cease to understand it. Profound ideas cannot, after all, be explained in the language of children." While his easygoing exploration of philosophers from Socrates to Nietzsche isn't exactly written for the <i>Blue's Clues</i> set, few readers will cease to understand it. Furthermore, it's a joy to read. De Botton's 1997 <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i> forged a new kind of lit crit: an exploration of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, delivered in the sweet-gummed envelope of an advice book. He returns to the self-help format here, this time plundering the great thinkers to puzzle out the way we ought to live.<p> What was stunning about the Proust book was de Botton's brazen annexing of a hallowed novelist to address lite emotional problems. That format is less arresting when applied to the philosophers, since which earnest philosophy major has not, from time to time, tried to apply the alpine heights of thought to his own humble worries? Usually, sophomoric attempts to turn to, say, Kant for advice on love tend to be unmitigated disasters. In de Botton's case, however, he is able to find consolation for a broken heart in Schopenhauer, consolation for inadequacy in Montaigne. Epicurus, usually associated with a love of luxury, is a solace for those of us without much money--and de Botton learns from him that "objects mimic in a material dimension what we require in a psychological one. We need to rearrange our minds but are lured towards new shelves. We buy a cashmere cardigan as a substitute for the counsel of friends."</p><p> Lest the reader become burdened by all this philosophizing, the book is peppered with illustrations--the section on Nietzsche of course includes a DC Comics drawing of Superman. And it's further leavened by the author's personal anecdotes and winning confessional tone. Early on, for instance, he admits his own gnawing need for popularity: "A desire to please led me to laugh at modest jokes like a parent on the opening night of a school play." Before he became a medicine man for the soul, de Botton was a first-rate novelist, and it shows in his writing. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"An enjoyable read... In clear, witty prose, de Botton...sets some of [the philosophers'] ideas to the mundane task of helping readers with their personal problems.... The quietly ironic style and eclectic approach will gratify many postmodern readers."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Sicilian Bb5 Revealed</h2><p>The Sicilian Bb5 is the most popular and successful Anti-Sicilian variation.

AUTHOR BIO: Huckleberry Finn Childhood Fuels Lisa Jackson's Novel Success When asked what has inspired her to write more than 50 novels brimming with adventure, intrigue, hot passion and high emotion, best-selling Oregon author Lisa Jackson gets a mischievous smile on her face. Then the words flow as fast as her fingers fly on her computer keyboard when she writes. Her eyes sparkling with memories, she tells stories of her youth, stories of a Huckleberry Finn childhood in the small lumber town of Molalla and on her grandparents' nearby farm in the hilly region of western Oregon. There in the old growth timber, Jackson rode bareback and raced along the ages-old sheep, cattle and deer trails. In the nearby river, she skinny-dipped and caught crawdads in her bare hands. An inventive child, she sneaked out of the house and rode her bicycle or horse in the moonlight and dreamed up childish pranks that would have done Tom Sawyer proud. <p> "Nobody could have had a better childhood," Jackson remarks, her twinkling eyes and got- away-with-something grin giving her a youthful appearance that defies the fact she is in her mid- forties and the mother of two college-age sons. "My childhood was enchanted. We were a small, tightly knit family. My mom and dad were and still are my greatest supporters." Why then does Jackson write lousy dads and conniving relatives into the plots of books that regularly earn berths on such national bestseller lists as USA Today's and Waldenbooks'? "I think the most intense angst people can experience is what can develop among family members, because our emotions run so deep there," Jackson replied. "Deep down, we care about these people, but being related doesn't mean we think alike or want the same things. I also think manipulative people are fascinating. Characters like that help me keep the readers' interest. I love it when readers write me to complain that they didn't get any sleep the night before because they had to finish my book." For her ability to write such reader-pleasing page turners, Jackson is sought after by publishers, currently writing for three. In style and career path, she has been compared to author Sandra Brown. Like the mega-New York Times bestselling author, Jackson built her reading audience in the romance genre. Like Brown, she went on to write bigger books splashed across a broad literary canvass that appeal to men as well as to women. As in Brown's newer novels, a romantic relationship is at the core of Jackson's stories, but there's a lot more going on, even in her shorter genre romance novels. In both authors' books, the reader encounters bold, strong heroines who inspire them to take charge of their own lives. The characters' gutsy nature brings to mind the indefatigable Jackson herself. </p><p> Jackson studied English literature at Oregon State University for two years before she married. In 1981, when her younger son was a year old, she began writing novels. But she decided she needed a steady income and, drawing on her experience in the banking field, applied for and landed a $9/hour bank job. "Before I could begin work, the woman who would have been my supervisor was arrested for embezzling, and that was the end of my job." Jackson recalls. "I wasn't too disappointed, because about then I sold my first book, A TWIST OF FATE, and my author career took off. In one of life's little ironies, though, the plot of that first book revolved around a woman suspected of bank embezzling." Since that first sale, Jackson has written enough novels to fill a bookcase. Drawing on her small-town upbringing, she writes contemporary novels that are more often than not set in rural areas, like her hometown in Oregon. Texas is the setting for UNSPOKEN, her November 1999 novel for Zebra Books. UNSPOKEN is the climax of Zebra's four-month Lisa Jackson promotion of four re-releases and one original title. Jackson also writes medieval romances set in 11th and 12th century Wales, such as DARK EMERALD (Topaz Books, March 1999). "The main thrust of my writing career is the contemporary novels, but I enjoy doing these period pieces," said Jackson, who earlier wrote as Susan Lynn Crose. "Women were so trod upon in medieval days. By nature of women's lot in life then, I can generate sympathy for the medieval heroines. They're underdogs from the get go! Tell me what woman doesn't root for the underdog!" To promote her five fall 1999 Zebra titles, the gregarious author will tour Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma and several other states. Recently divorced, Jackson is being booked to speak for singles' clubs, with her tongue-in-cheek insights into dating, including "Lisa Jackson's Dating Tips for the New Millennium: Hero or Zero?" </p><p> Jackson's 1999 publishing schedule is impressive. In addition to the five Zebra titles, a Lisa Jackson medieval, a category romance and a selection in a Christmas anthology will be published. When not writing, Jackson enjoys spectator sports, reading, watching "The X-Files" and socializing now that she's a single mom. Her favorite authors include Pat Conroy, Nelson DeMille, Stephen King, Patricia Cornwell, Dick Francis and other authors who also write compelling page turners.</p>Lisa Jackson has been writing romantic fiction for fifteen years. Over sixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than a dozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon, where she still resides with her two teenage sons. Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailing answer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, and always, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;</p><h2>The Mermaid and the Minotaur: Sexual Arrangements and Human Malaise</h2><p>Examines the reasons for our continued consent to traditional sexual arrangements and suggests that female domination of early child care is responsible for a lowering of human intelligence and creativity</p><p><b>Dorothy Dinnerstein</b><br><br>Dorothy Dinnerstein was born in a poor Jewish section of the Bronx, New York City, in 1923.

Donahue gives readers a rare and exciting glimpse of life on the Great Lakes in the fateful year of 1871. But it is much more than just a collection of stories about the vessels that were lost between Duluth and Quebec and from Oswego to Chicago. The stories in this book take a slice out of Great Lakes history and paint a broad view of what was happening during the dynamic years after the Civil War. The stories are true accounts about the hundreds of disasters and near-disasters that happened in just one year. They also look into the way politics of the period affected shipping, the lumber empire and the opening of a way for larger ships and heavier cargos.

Fresh from her success reporting on the first Everest ascent in 1953, she spent a year journeying by car, train, ship, and aircraft across the United States. I did not know it then, and nor did America, but chance had brought me across the Atlantic at the very apex of American happiness,&#x201d; writes Morris in her new introduction. The author was then James Morris, and America&#x2019;s identity was different then, too. In brilliant prose, Morris records with exuberance and wonder a time of innocence in America. The prose sparkles, and everything [Morris] tells glitters.&#x201d; San Francisco Chronicle</p><p>Jan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea. Her books include Coronation Everest, Venice, The Pax Britannica Trilogy (Heaven&#39;s Command, Pax Britannica, and Farewell the Trumpets), and Conundrum. Hav, her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006."A delight to read...conveys with sustained excitement and remarkable accuracy the sights and sounds of the American scene." -- <i>Sunday Times (London)</i><br><br>"The spirited writing, permeated with a sense of excitement and discovery, makes it a delight to read." -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"This is one of the very best travel books, one of the very best impressions of contemporary America..." -- <i>The Saturday Review</i></p><h2>al-Kindi&#39;s Treatise on Cryptanalysis</h2><p>al-Kindi was born around 801 AD and died in 873. Often referred to as &#34;the philosopher of the Arabs,&#34; he received most of his education in Baghdad, where he built a very impressive library. Due to the persistence of the authors, and the generous help and assistance of many colleagues, a number of these original manuscripts have been recovered, and a whole series has been dedicated to the translation, of which this is the first and one of the most significant as it basically makes the birth of cryptology as a science. The book under review starts off with an analytic study of cryptology in the Arab civilization in Chapter 1, and continues with a study of al-Kindi&#39;s treatise in Chapter 2. Finally, Chapter 3 is a translation of al-Kindi&#39;s book, with translation on the left and a photocopy of the translated page on the right. The main topics of al-Kindi&#39;s book are methods of cryptanalysis, encipherments, cryptanalysis of certain encipherments and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic. All in all, this book is an excellent account of the origins of cryptology as an Arabic Science, and at the same time a good overview of related sciences in the Arab world at the same time, e.g. in mathematics (combinatorics) and linguistics, which is highly recommendable reading.</p><p></p><h2>Holy Warrior: A Novel of Robin Hood (The Outlaw Chronicles, 2)</h2><p><p>After the events of <i>Outlaw</i>, Robin of Locksley&#x2015;and his sidekick and narrator, Alan Dale&#x2015;finds himself in a very different England and a very changed world. </p><p>In 1190 A.D. Richard the Lionheart, the new King of England, has launched his epic crusade to seize Jerusalem from the Saracens. Marching with the vast royal army is Britain's most famous, most feared, most ferocious warrior: the Outlaw of Nottingham, the Earl of Locksley&#x2015;Robin Hood himself. With his band of loyal men at his side, Robin cuts a bloody swath on the brutal journey east. Daring and dangerous, he can outwit and outlast any foe&#x2015;but the battlefields of the Holy Land are the ultimate proving ground. And within Robin's camp lurks a traitor&#x2015;a hidden enemy determined to assassinate England's most dangerous rogue. </p><p>Richly imagined and furiously paced, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters, <i>Holy Warrior </i>is adventure, history and legend at its finest.</p></p><p><p>ANGUS DONALD is a longtime journalist, now novelist, and lives in England. He is at work on his next book in the Outlaw series.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>I hesitated long before beginning this labor, and had resolutely made up my mind never to set down on parchment this part of my early life, until I heard a man in an alehouse in Nottingham the other day, a professional storyweaver, and a good one, extol the virtues of lionhearted King Richard and his brave warriors who made the Great Pilgrimage to the Holy Land more than forty years ago. The man described the magnificent killing skills of the steel-wrapped Christian knights, and the deathless glory that they won against the Saracens at Acre and Arsuf; he spoke of the certain rewards in Heaven for those who fell in such a noble cause, and the rich rewards on Earth, in plunder and booty, for those who returned&nbsp;...<br>But this eloquent tale-spinner never mentioned the true sights, smells and sounds of a battlefield after a great victory&#x2014;the ones that stay with you and plague your dreams. He did not speak of the corpses, thousands of them, chalk-faced and staring, stiffened by death and heaped like cut logs one on top of the other; nor the belly-slashed horses, stepping in their own entrails, eyes rolling, trembling and whinnying with fear; nor the iron-meat stench of fresh blood and spattered shit, an odor that coats the back of your throat and will not easily be washed away; nor the drone of a hundred thousand gore-glutted flies; nor the ceaseless, hopeless shrieking of the badly wounded that makes you yearn to stuff your ears against their pain.<br>He did not speak of the horror of killing a man close to; the wild kick of his death-writhe against your body, the stench of his onion breath on your cheek; the hot blood washing over your hand as you work the blade deeper into his flesh. And the sick dizziness and relief you feel when the deed is done and the man lies by your boots, suddenly no more than a loose bag of bones and meat.<br>The storyteller did not lie&#x2014;and yet he did not tell the truth. And when I saw the eyes of the young men in that tavern shining in the firelight as they listened to his stories of bold Christian heroes carving their way through the ranks of cowardly unbelievers, I knew that I must set down the true events of that great endeavor four decades past, the true courses of those far-off battles, as I saw them with my own youthful eyes.<br>This is not a tale of bold heroes and everlasting glory, it is a tale of useless slaughter and lakes of innocent blood; a tale of greed, cruelty and hatred&#x2014;and of love; it is also a tale of loyalty and friendship and forgiveness. Most of all it is the tale of my master Robert Odo, the great Earl of Locksley, the man once known throughout the land as Robin Hood&#x2014;a cunning thief, an ice-hearted murderer and, God forgive me, for many years my good friend.<br>As I inscribe this story of my long-ago journeying at a writing stand in the great hall at the manor of Westbury, I feel the crushing weight of my years. My legs ache from standing at my sloped lectern for so long. My hands, which grip penknife and quill, are cramped from hours of work. But our merciful Lord has spared me these past fifty-eight years, through much danger, battle and bloodshed, and I have faith that he will give me the strength to complete this task.<br>Through the wide-open hall door, a light breeze steals in and stirs the rushes on the floor, wafting the warm scents of early autumn to where I scratch away at this parchment: the sun-baked dust of the courtyard outside, cut grass in my drying barns and a tint of sweetness from the fruit that hangs heavy in my orchard.<br>It has been a fat year for us here at Westbury: a hot summer ripened the crops, and now they are all gathered in, and the granaries are filled to the rafters with sacks of wheat, oats and barley; daily the cows give up their sweet milk, the pigs are gorging on beech mast in the woods, and Marie, my daughter-in-law, who runs this manor for me, is a contented woman. God be praised for His mercy.<br>In the spring, her cousin Osric, a portly widower of middle years, came here to occupy the position of bailiff, and he brought with him his two strong sons Edmund and Alfred to toil in my fields as waged farmhands. I cannot say that I like Osric: he may be the most upright, honest, hardworking fellow in Christendom, but he is as dull as unsalted spelt bread. Officious, too, when it comes to his dealings with my villeins. And yet, since his arrival at the manor, he has immeasurably transformed my life for the better. What was once a forlorn, untended estate of weed-choked fields and tumbledown buildings is now a bustling place of industry and plenty. He has collected those rents from my tenants that were long overdue; at harvest time he rose before dawn and chivvied into the fields the villeins of Westbury who owed me week-work, and arranged a modest daily payment for the franklins of the village who did not, but who were prepared to labor on my demesne. He has brought order and prosperity and happiness to the manor&#x2014;and yet I still cannot like him.<br>It may be that I do not care for him because he is such an ugly man&#x2014;round in the middle like a ball, with short arms and stubby fingers, and his face, under a nearly bald scalp, is pinched like a mole&#x2019;s; his nose is too large, his mouth too small, and an expression of worry permanently haunts his tiny eyes&#x2014;but I prefer to think it is because he has no music in his soul, no wild untamed joy in his heart.<br>Nevertheless, Osric&#x2019;s coming has been a good thing. Last year, a melancholy air had pervaded the manor. Marie and I were both struggling to find a reason to carry on living after the death from a sickness of my son, her husband Rob. God be praised we have a living memory of him in my grandson and namesake Alan, who will be eight years old this Christmas&#x2014;a healthy, raucous little boy.<br>Alan is in thrall to Osric&#x2019;s younger son Alfred. He looks on the young man as a hero, a kind of demigod, and he copies everything the tall farmhand does. Alfred had taken to wearing a band of linen around his brow, to catch the sweat before it dripped into his eyes as he worked his sickle on the standing wheat. And so, of course, little Alan must fashion a similar cloth headband for himself, too. When Alfred let slip that he was fond of buttermilk, Alan began following him around with a pitcher of the liquor in case he might be thirsty. Harmless boyish foolishness, you will say. Possibly, but I have decided that I will soon send Alan away to be educated in accordance with his rank at another manor far away. There, he will learn to ride and fight like a knight, and dance and sing, and write Latin and French: I do not want him growing up to be a field hand. This infatuation with Alfred may well be harmless but I know that blind admiration of an older man by a younger fellow can cause great anger and hurt when the boy discovers that his idol is not the hero that he seems. I had that very experience myself with Robin of Locksley.<br>My master first appeared to me as a heroic figure: brave, strong and noble&#x2014;just as Alfred might appear to young Alan&#x2014;but I remember well the sickening lurch in my belly when I learned that Robin was not so, that he was as grasping and cruel and selfish as any other mortal man.<br>I know that I am not being just to Robin when I castigate him for being selfish, cruel and greedy: it was I who misunderstood him, not he who deliberately tricked me. But I still feel rancor, and shame, when I remember the good and noble men who died so that Robin might gain riches. But those who read these parchments shall judge for themselves, and in these pages I shall write as truly as I am able about Robin&#x2019;s adventures beyond the sea, and mine, in that hate-ridden land where men butcher each other by the thousands in the name of God, that country of crushing heat and choking dust, of demon scorpions and giant hairy spiders&#x2014;the place that men call Outremer.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Ghost, my gray gelding, was exhausted and I, too, was weary beyond belief. We had traveled many hundreds of miles together in the past few weeks&#x2014;to London, Winchester, Nottingham and back&#x2014;and, as we rode up the steep slope from the valley of the Locksley River in the county of Yorkshire toward the castle high on the hill, I patted his marbled gray neck and murmured a few words of encouragement. &#x201c;Nearly home, boy, nearly home, and there&#x2019;s a dish of hot oat mash waiting for you.&#x201d; Ghost pricked up his ears at my words, and even seemed to increase his pace a fraction. As we plodded up the endless grassy hill, scattering ewes and their gawky lambs out of our path, I could make out the square shape of the church of St. Nicholas above me and behind it, on the skyline, the high wooden tower and stoutly palisaded courtyard of Kirkton Castle, the fortress of my master, which overlooks the Vale of Locksley. I wallowed in a great sense of homecoming and the warm glow of a task well done. My head was full of good, fresh intelligence; important, dangerous news, and in my saddlebags, wrapped and well-hidden, was a costly gift. I felt like a hunter, returning after a day in the wild with a fine catch: a satisfying blend of fatigue and joy.<br>It was early spring, in the year of Our Lord 1190, and, it seemed to me on that beautiful day, all was right in the world: noble King Richard, that most Christian warrior, was on the throne of England, the officials he had placed in positions of power were said to be governing wisely, and he himself would soon be setting off on a great and holy adventure to recover Jerusalem, the navel of the world, from the grip of the Saracen hordes, perhaps bringing about the Second Coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ by his actions. All England prayed that he might be successful. Best of all, I had successfully completed one of my first assignments for my master, Robert Odo, the newly created Earl of Locksley, and Lord of Kirkton, Sheffield, Ecclesfield, Hallam, Grimesthorpe and Greasbrough, and dozens of smaller manors across Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and De...</p><h2>DEAD BY MORNING</h2><p>Leo Martindale returns to Longford Hall after 20 years, and is soon found dead on a snowy February morning. Inspector Thanet suspects murder, but there are many suspects. This is the author&#39;s ninth Inspector Thanet novel, her fifth, &#34;Last Seen Alive&#34;, won the 1985 CWA Silver Dagger Award.</p><p>Dorothy Simpson worked as a French teacher and then as a marriage-guidance counsellor, before turning to writing full time. She is married with three children and lives near Maidstone, Kent The fifth book in the series, LAST SEEN ALIVE, won the Crime Writers&#39; Association Award in 1985.Simpson's ( Suspicious Death ) mastery of the police procedural will again dazzle devotees as she sends Inspector Luke Thanet of Sturrenden CID out on his ninth investigation. After an absence of more than 20 years, Leo Martindale returns to his ancestral estate, Longford Hall, to claim his inheritance, only to find that his sister and her husband have converted his home to a country hotel. Two days later, Martindale is found dead in a snow-covered ditch, apparently a hit-and-run victim. Clues suggesting murder lead Inspector Thanet to the Longford estate, where he compiles a list of suspects, all with reason for wishing Martindale dead, and, more importantly, all with opportunity to kill him. While struggling with a web of dark, twisting secrets, Thanet must cope simultaneously with his teenaged daughter Bridget and with his new superior. Skillfully plotted, replete with vivid characters, this mystery is a page turner to the end. Yet once more it's the likable and humane Inspector, and the glimpse into his family life, that gives the novel its rewarding texture. Simpson gets better and better.

He melts, of course. And then he turns into water, evaporates, returns to the sky and falls again as rain or, as in this case, snow. The publisher describes the book as a modern-day fable about how our attachments to people and things live on, though they change and sometimes disappear.

Whichever it is, this is a charming story, delightfully illustrated. -- http://parentsintouch.co.uk It is a delightful story about a snowman and his journey. You may think that a snowman stays firmly put on the ground. But in fact in this story the sun warms him and first of all he melts and then he evaporates and climbs high into the sky. He turns into a cloud drifting free in the sky until it gets cold again and he falls as snow on the ground. Along come the children and once again he becomes a snowman.

I'm one of the millions who have been blessed by her voice and touched by her words of wisdom. Her story is one of grace, hope, and second chances. May it impact all who read it. (<i>Max Lucado, pastor; author, Unshakable Hope</i>)<br><br>That voice! I'm talking about the voice of Sandi's heart--the voice that invites us into her struggles and allows all of us to see part of our own story in hers. I'm talking about the voice that is constantly championing others and making them feel seen, valued, and heard. This book will help restore the voices of so many who feel sidelined and silenced. (<i>Natalie Grant, singer</i>)<br><br>I've known Sandi ever since she was a kid singing backup at our studio. I've always loved her talent, her energy, and her heart. This refreshingly honest account of her story sets a remarkable example for anyone who wants his or her voice to make an eternal difference in this world. (<i>Bill Gaither, singer</i>)<br><br>I love Sandi's voice, her heart, and her passion for Christ. I was deeply moved by the transparency of this book. She shares her journey at a depth that few are brave enough to offer. So find a quiet place and sit with her story for a while. Perhaps you too will find your voice. (<i>Sheila Walsh, author, It's Okay Not to Be Okay</i>)<br><br>My favorite kind of spiritual leader is the one who tells the truth and gives others permission to tell the truth. I don't need shiny, polished, or tidy. I need genuine. Sandi, my dear friend, whom I love wholeheartedly, has given us this and more in The Voice. (<i>Jen Hatmaker, author; speaker; cofounder, Legacy Collective</i>)<br><br>I have a voice. It's high pitched, a bit nasal, and as country as cornbread, but it has taken me to places I never dreamed I could go as a comedian. But Sandi is more than just an amazing voice; she is a friend, a mentor, a teacher. This book moved me, challenged me, changed me, and my heart and voice are much improved having traversed these pages with Sandi. (<i>Chonda Pierce, comedian</i>)<br><br>I'm so proud of Sandi for having the courage to share the truth about her life and how hearing God's voice helped her discover her own. This book will encourage and inspire you to find your voice as you pursue the dreams and desires God has put in your heart. (<i>Robert Morris, founding senior pastor, Gateway Church; author, The Blessed Life</i>)<br><br>As I read this book, I realized how hard Sandi has fought against circumstances and experiences that could have silenced her, and it made me respect her even more. She has done what she does best: welcome others to listen to her voice and find their own as they do. (<i>Angie Smith, speaker; author, Seamless, What Women Fear</i>)<br><br>Sandi is gifting us with an encore performance. Sharing wisdom from the latest third of her life, she is candid about the complexity of her journey and the depth of her faith, and we are once again encouraged, strengthened, and made aware of God's love for us all.

As the unlikely friends work together to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, Dorothy can't help but wonder if she will ever make it home to Kansas. A classic story that has been enjoyed by readers of all ages since 1900, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> is considered the first true American fairy tale. Drawings by illustrators W. W. Denslow and Cherie Zamazing add an imaginative touch the story, making this volume a treasured keepsake.</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>Blue Cheese Breath and Stinky Feet: How to Deal With Bullies</h2><p>With the help of his teacher and his parents, Steve devises &#34;The Plan&#34;, strategies for avoiding, defending against, and disarming a bully who has been tormenting him at school.</p><p></p><h2>Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber: The New Musical (The Great Songwriters)</h2><p><em>The New York Times</em> called Stephen Sondheim "the greatest and perhaps best known artist in the American musical theater," while two months earlier, the same paper referred to his contemporary, Andrew Lloyd-Webber as "the most commercially successful composer in history." Whatever their individual achievements might be, it is agreed by most critics that these two colossi have dominated world musical theater for the last quarter century and hold the key to the direction the musical stage will take in the future. <br> Here in the third volume of Stephen Citron's distinguished series <em>The Great Songwriters</em>--in depth studies that illuminated the musical contributions, careers, and lives of Noel Coward and Cole Porter (<em>Noel &amp; Cole: The Sophisticates</em>), and Oscar Hammerstein 2nd and Alan Jay Lerner, (<em>The</em> <em>Wordsmiths</em>)--this eminent musicologist has taken on our two leading contemporary contributors to the lyric stage. His aim has not been to compare or judge one's merits over the other, but to make the reader discover through their works and those of their contemporaries, the changes and path of that glorious artform we call Musical Theater.<br> In his quest, Citron offers unique insight into each artist's working methods, analyzing their scores--including their early works and works-in-progress. As in Citron's previously critically acclaimed books in this series, great significance is given to the impact their youthful training and private lives have had upon their amazing creative output. Beginning with Sondheim's lyrics-only works, <em>West Side Story, Gypsy, Do I Hear A Waltz?</em> through his scores for <em>Saturday Night, Company, Anyone Can Whistle, Follies, Pacific Overtures, A Little Night Music, Sweeney Todd, Merrily We Roll</em> <em>Along, Sunday In the Park, Into the Woods, Assassins</em>, and <em>Passion</em>, all these milestones of musical theater have been explored. Lloyd-Webber's musical contribution from his early works, <em>The Likes of Us</em> and <em>Joseph</em> to <em>Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Cats, Starlight Express, Aspects of Love, By Jeeves,</em> <em>The Phantom of the Opera, Song &amp; Dance, Mass, Sunset Boulevard</em> to <em>Whistle Down the Wind</em> are also thoroughly analyzed.<br> The works of these two splendid artists are clarified for the casual or professional reader in context with their contemporaries. Complete with a quadruple chronology (Sondheim, Lloyd-Webber, US Theater, British Theater), copious quotations from their works, and many never before published illustrations, the future of the artform that is the crowning achievement of the 20th century is made eminently clear in this book. <em>Sondheim &amp; Lloyd-Webber</em> is a must-read for anyone interested in the contemporary theater.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Citron</strong> is a composer, lyricist, and lecturer. He is the author of <em>Songwriting</em>, the standard reference work on the subject, <em>The Musical From the Inside Out, Noel &amp; Cole</em>, and <em>The Wordsmiths</em>. He lives in New York City.<br><br>"Well worth reading. He supplies a great deal of fascinating biographical information; his musical analyses are blessedly easy to follow; he quotes extensively from critics, and points out positive qualities in both composers which have often been overlooked."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"A well-written, engaging account--simultaneously successful as critical history and biographical study--by an author obviously in love with his subject."--<em>American Theater</em><br><p></p><br>Acclaim for the first two volumes of<br>Stephen Citron's distinguished series <em>The Great Songwriters</em><br><br><strong>Noel and Cole</strong><br><strong>The Sophisticates</strong><br><br>"A must for the theater buff."<br> --<em>Performance Magazine</em><br><br>"A courageous and highly successful chronicle of two great legends of the theater, music, and film worlds during the first half of the 20th century."<br> --<em>Library Journal</em><br><br>"For would-be songwriters, the book seems priceless.

Scott Heim's lyrical tale of three outcasts (a 17-year-old boy, a 32-year-old woman, and an old woman) works its eerie magic on two levels. On one level, it's about people so vilified by society that their ambitions come from horror stories: Boris is writing a story in which the three friends will rise from the grave "with worms on [their] wrists like gray bracelets" and wreak zombie vengeance, and Sarah wants to "star in movies where everyone will suffer sobbing and she alone will survive for top billing in the sequels." On another level, it's about an obsessive desire for a love object (Boris's for another boy he sees as "half-hyena, half-swan") that is so fierce, it can only be consummated in death.Our Gang meets Godzilla in a leather bar on the Great Plains, in Heim's disappointing follow-up to Mysterious Skin (1995). Within a particular gay subculture, Kansas may function as a kind of byword for homoerotic camp, but for most people who've never been there it sounds like a quiet enough place where very little goes on. They'll hardly be prepared, then, for life in Lawrence, the university town where Boris, Harriet, and Sarah have formed one of the most unlikely trios since the brothers Karamazov. Harriet, in her 60s, was the mother of Marshall, who was a friend and mentor to the gay Boris and the prodigiously heterosexual Sarah, both of them CINCs (Children in Need of Care) from the local juvenile detention center. Marshal died recently, and his mother acts out her grief by hanging with his two teenaged friends, both creative types themselves: Boris is writing a horror novel for school, and Sarah is fascinated by cinema. Sarah's obsessive nymphomania, which landed her in the juvenile home in the first place, has come back to haunt her in the person of Rex, a local redneck who's stalking her. Boris, in love with Rex, would give anything to be stalked, but Rex doesn't know he's alive. There are vivid, detailed flashbacks describing Sarah's sexual adventures. There are lyrical and sad flashbacks describing Harriet's recollections of her son. There are scenes from Boris's novel. And there is a confused subplot concerning the disappearance of young girls in town, with all the usual suspicions and hysteria, that adds up to little in the end. Heim is a master of unnecessary detail who badly overestimates the amount of literary freight his train can pull. In a contrived and obvious climax, his story finally seems not so much fulfilled as denuded. Empty posturing without much lurking behind it, save adolescent nihilism and more than a hint of misogyny. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Though the game is never actually played in Kate Atkinson's remarkable novel, <i>Human Croquet</i>, the parallels between plot and pastime are undeniable. Atkinson, winner of the 1995 Whitbread Award in Britain, tells the story of Isobel Fairfax and her older brother, Charles. The children's parents vanished when they were young, leaving them to the care of their grandmother, now dead, and their Aunt Vinny. Recently their father has returned with "the Debbie-wife" in tow, and they all live in Arden, the family's ancestral home built on the foundations of the original manor house that burned to the ground in 1605. According to family legend, the first Fairfax took a wife who mysteriously disappeared one day, leaving in her wake a curse on the Fairfax name. More than 300 years later, Fairfax descendants are still struggling with this painful legacy. <p>Atkinson's novel is obviously not rooted in dull reality. Narrator Isobel has an uncanny knowledge of past and future events; Charles is obsessed with the concept of parallel universes and time travel; and a faery curse hangs over everybody. Fortunately, Kate Atkinson is a masterful writer who manages to keep her world of wonders in check. <i>Human Croquet</i> is no ordinary novel, and readers who venture into the Fairfax universe are in for a magical ride.</p>"Wonderfully eloquent and forceful Kate Atkinson goes at the same pace in her second novel as she did in her first...welcome back, wild north-easter...brilliant and engrossing"<br>-Penelope Fitzgerald, <i>Evening Standart</i><p>"Huge, exhilarating, loving and detailed eruption of a novel...an utterly intoxicating display of novelistic elan...big and joyous, literary and accessible...storytelling at it buoyant best"<br>-<i>The Scotsman</i></p><p>"Vivid, richly imaginative, hilarious and frightening by turns"<br>-Cressida Connolly, <i>Observer</i></p></p><h2>The Puritans in America: A Narrative Anthology</h2><p><p>The whole destiny of America is contained in the first Puritans who landed on these shores, wrote de Tocqueville. These newcomers, and the range of their intellectual achievements and failures, are vividly depicted in <i>The Puritans in America</i>. Exiled from England, the Puritans settled in what Cromwell called &#x201c;a poor, cold, and useless&#x201d; place&#x2015;where they created a body of ideas and aspirations that were essential in the shaping of American religion, politics, and culture.</p><p>In a felicitous blend of documents and narrative Alan Heimert and Andrew Delbanco recapture the sweep and restless change of Puritan thought from its incipient Americanism through its dominance in New England society to its fragmentation in the face of dissent from within and without. A general introduction sketches the Puritan environment, and shorter introductions open each of the six sections of the collection. Thirty-eight writers are included&#x2015;among these Cotton, Bradford, Bradstreet, Winthrop, Rowlandson, Taylor, and the Mathers&#x2015;as well as the testimony of Anne Hutchinson and documents illustrating the witchcraft crisis. The works, several of which are published here for the first time since the seventeenth century, are presented in modern spelling and punctuation.</p><p>Despite numerous scholarly probings, Puritanism remains resistant to categories, whether those of Perry Miller, Max Weber, or Christopher Hill. This new anthology&#x2015;the first major interpretive collection in nearly fifty years&#x2015;reveals the beauty and power of Puritan literature as it emerged from the pursuit of self-knowledge in the New World.</p></p><p>Alan Heimert is Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature, Harvard University.<br><br>Andrew Delbanco is the Mendelson Family Chair of American Studies and Julian Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.&#x201c;By presenting Puritan sermons, reminiscences, poetry, and other writings in a chronological fashion, Heimert and Delbanco have captured the spirit of a vibrant New England, experiencing social, religious, and economic change. The editors&#x2019; brief introductions to many of the selections make this volume especially attractive to students of Puritan history and literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This anthology pays tribute to Puritan trailblazers in political, religious and literary realms and casts them in a new and sparkling light.

By defining Puritanism as an affective style and them allowing us to trace that style&#x2019;s literary effusions over a century, Heimert and Delbanco invite us to investigate how communities organize their emotions and how time transfigures culturally prescribed feeling, a task well worth taking up. If the heart has its reason, it has its history too.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles L.

The new wave in genealogy is authentication technology. Authentication begins with new-wave technology used to gather population registers.Compare the new technology to the old method of door-to-door census taking, tombstone tracings, and city directory publishing. No, genealogists are not using smart cards this year, but smart card technology is being used to compile population registers in Europe.The future holds a new wave of technology used for authentication for banking transactions being applied to other areas. Currently this technology is used for collecting details for population registrars such as census taking.The application for research is of interest to family historians, librarians, and governments. It&#39;s already in use by private industry for electronic authentication.Family history is now about intelligent connections, whether it&#39;s a population registrar, census detail, or electronic identity for banking. Smart card genealogy began in 1998 in Finland with governments seeking to put census and population registers in an electronic form that would be available to researchers, and these applications are going global.</p><p>Popular science journalist, Anne Hart, a Mensa member, is the author of 56+ published how-to books and numerous novels and plays.

Raised to the rank of captain for gallantry under fire, Edgemont proved his mettle in the bruising British victory over the Spanish fleet at the Battle of St. Vincent. Now married and in command of the twenty-eight-gun frigate Louisa, the young captain sails toward a day of destiny&#x2013;for himself and for England.<br>The year is 1798. The war between England and revolutionary France has reached a bloody stalemate, with England in the ascendancy at sea and France unchallenged on the Continent, thanks in large part to an unorthodox twenty-eight-year-old general named Napoleon Bonaparte. But the French, secretly amassing a powerful fleet, mean to break the impasse.<br>When rumors of the French preparations leak, the Admiralty dispatches a squadron of seven ships&#x2013;among them the Louisa&#x2013;under the command of Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson to investigate. Blindsided by a storm of ferocious intensity, the ships scatter across the seas.<br>After the storm subsides, the damaged frigates limp back to the rendezvous point. But there is no sign of Nelson&#x2019;s flagship, Vanguard, nor of two other ships of the line. Edgemont fears that the pugnacious rear admiral has pressed on with the mission.<br>Putting his career on the line by disobeying direct orders, Edgemont sets out in pursuit of Nelson and the French fleet on a treacherous voyage along the Tuscan coast. As tensions among the crew threaten to explode into open insubordination or worse, Edgemont makes an unexpected discovery in Naples that may seriously compromise his mission.<br>When the missing French fleet turns up off the shores of Egypt, conveying an army tens of thousands strong, Edgemont is suddenly thrown into a crisis of conscience. As circumstances grow dire and require heroic action, the fate of the crucial battle effectively lies in Edgemont&#x2019;s hands&#x2013;as does the course of history.</p><p>Jay Worrall is the author of Sails on the Horizon. Born into a military family and raised as a Quaker, Worrall grew up in a number of countries around the world. During the Vietnam War he worked with refugees in the Central Highlands of that country, and afterwards taught English in Japan. Worrall has also worked to develop innovative and humane prison programs, policies, and administration. He is married and the proud father of five sons, and he now lives and works in Pennsylvania.ONE<br> May 19, 1798<br><br> South of Cape Sicie, Gulf of Lion<br><br> The Mediterranean<br><br> EMERALD is signaling again, sir," lieutenant jacob Talmage reported with a heavy emphasis on the word "again." Talmage was the newly appointed first lieutenant to His Majesty's frigate Louisa, and at thirty-five was almost ten years older than her captain. "Sir, it's the second time. It says--"<br><br> "I know what it says, Mr. Talmage," Charles Edgemont interrupted. He stood by the weather rail of his quarterdeck with a long glass held up to one eye, the other screwed shut. He didn't need the telescope to read Emerald's signal flags, as she was only a mile and a half to the north. It was the surface of the sea beyond the larger British frigate that held his attention. "Captain Pigott wants us to add more sail," he said to prove that he'd seen the signal. He lowered the glass and turned toward the lieutenant. "He thinks we're lagging behind."<br><br> "Shall I give the orders, sir?" Talmage asked.<br><br> "Not yet, if you please. However, you may hoist the acknowledge." He glanced again at Emerald and her signal flags, numbers three-seven-four, Increase sail in conformity to weather. Pigott was flying all his plain sail from courses to royals and a full set of jibs. Louisa carried only topsails and topgallants in addition to her jib and mizzen. The wind was moderate enough for more canvas; the sky was a low dull gray, somewhat darker to the north. He'd checked the barometer in his cabin a quarter hour before and found it falling. The sea had a brisk chop, stirred by a gusting breeze, with just a hint of underlying swells, but its surface seemed uneven in the distance, unsettled. Add to that his ankle ached, a reminder of an earlier injury that didn't usually bother him. Something was wrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it. The air seemed . . . hollow.<br><br> A sharp bang echoed across the water. "Sir, she's fired a gun," Talmage said, clearly perturbed at Charles's inaction. The single cannon firing from Emerald was to emphasize the order to increase sail and to show Pigott's displeasure.<br><br> "All right," Charles said, irritated at Pigott for his impatience, irritated at Talmage for hectoring him, and irritated at himself for not being able to make up his mind. "Send the men into the rigging."<br><br> "Thank you, sir," Talmage said with both relief and exasperation in his voice.<br><br> "Just send them onto the yards, Mr. Talmage. That should please Pigott for the moment. Don't have them bend on any additional canvas just yet."<br><br> "But sir, you have been ordered--"<br><br> "I know my duty, both to Pigott and the king, thank you," Charles snapped, his patience wearing. "See to it, please." To forestall any further debate, he turned away to survey the rest of the small squadron spread out over the sea. They were seven ships in all, under the command of Horatio Nelson. The squadron constituted the first naval force the Admiralty had ordered into the Mediterranean in almost two years. Three were two-decker, seventy-four-gun ships of the line: Orion, Alexander, and Nelson's own flagship, Vanguard. These were hull down well to the south, and Charles could just see their masts in the distance.<br><br> Captain John Pigott of Emerald, a thirty-six-gun, eighteen-pounder frigate, was the senior captain among the three frigates present and thus in command when they were detached. The others were the handsome thirty-two-gun twelve-pounder Terpsichore, commanded by Captain Edward Bedford, and Charles's Louisa, the smallest, rated at twenty-eight guns. Charles was the least senior captain of the three. He found Bedford both competent and friendly. Pigott, however, with eighteen years' seniority, struck him as rigid, unimaginative, autocratic, and altogether too ready to send up signal flags, punctuated by guns, on the most trivial of matters.<br><br> The seventh ship in Nelson's squadron was the brig sloop Pylades, with her two square-rigged masts and fourteen six-pounder cannon, under Commander Daniel Bevan. Charles and Bevan had served together and been close friends for most of their naval careers. Bevan, a Welshman and formerly the first lieutenant on Louisa, had also been promoted as a result of the encounter with the Spanish frigate Santa Brigida. Ironically, Bevan's promotion was seen by the Admiralty as a compliment to Charles, and while he was pleased for his friend's advancement, he secretly would have been even more pleased if Bevan had been left where he was. Charles was not altogether comfortable with Talmage.<br><br> He had been told that the squadron's purpose was to show the British flag in the Mediterranean after so long an absence. He knew that their mission also had to do with the information that the American party had brought with them from Cadiz. Cape Sicie, the principal landfall for the port of Toulon, lay just over the horizon. He assumed that they would look into the port the following morning. That is, if the weather cooperated.<br><br> "The hands are aloft, as you requested," Talmage reported. At least the lieutenant was making an attempt to be accommodating, Charles thought. "And are awaiting your orders, sir," the lieutenant added, which spoiled the whole thing.<br><br> Charles raised the glass again to study the horizon to the north. The sky had grown noticeably darker, and the surface of the sea in the distance seemed to have turned a pale gray, almost white. He felt an uncomfortable knot growing in the pit of his stomach. As he lowered the glass, the breeze faltered, and then a fresh gust passed over the ship from out of the north, causing a momentary slatting of the sails.<br><br> "The wind's backing, sir," said Samuel Eliot, standing by the binnacle with his nose high, as if smelling the air.<br><br> "What do you think?" Charles asked.<br><br> "I don't like it. This region is prone to rapid anemological changes." Eliot, a solidly rotund man with apple cheeks mostly covered by impressive muttonchops, served as Louisa's sailing master. Partly deaf and well into his fifties, he seemed to have an unerring sense of the ways of the sea and a no-nonsense, practical manner that Charles respected deeply. That Eliot might be concerned was enough.<br><br> "Mr. Talmage, get the topgallants off her and strike their masts to the deck. I want all of the canvas off except the fore and mainmast topsails."<br><br> "But, sir," Talmage protested, "you can't--"<br><br> "I can," Charles replied in a tone to end the discussion. "See to it now, if you please.<br><br> "Mr. Winchester!" he bellowed toward a lean figure standing erect in the waist of the ship. Stephen Winchester, at twenty, was younger than either Charles or Talmage, and had served as Louisa's second lieutenant since Charles took command. With Bevan promoted, he had asked to have Winchester raised to first, but Admiral St. Vincent had refused and appointed the presumably more experienced Talmage instead. Winchester was also, by some small coincidence, newly married to Charles's sister, Eleanor, which may have had some influence on his preference.<br><br> "Yes, sir?" Winchester called back, starting up the aft ladderway toward the quarterdeck.<br><br> "Clear the decks. See that the guns are double-breeched, if you will, and that the ship's boats are secure."<br><br> "Aye-aye, sir," Winchester replied.<br><br> "Mr. Beechum," Charles called to the gangly signals midshipman standing across the deck by the lee rail.<br><br> "Sir?" the boy answered smartly as he approached.<br><br> "You may signal Emerald: 'Submit, storm approaching north-by-northwest.' Do you know the flags?"<br><br> "Yes, sir," Beechum answered with a small smile, "but I'll just use the signals book to double-check." Charles had been encouraging Beechum to memorize the signals book entire, something he had been required to do as a young midshipman. He'd found it painful.<br><br> "Very good, see to it quickly, if you please."<br><br> Charles turned, glass in hand, to look over the weather rail again. He didn't bother to raise the telescope. The horizon to the north and northwest had become an ugly thick gray that reached from the sea surface high into the cloud cover above. He thought he could see the muted flash of lightning within, but no sound reached him. The sea beyond Emerald was a surging froth of white kicked up by a rapidly approaching squall line. He noted with momentary satisfaction that Pigott had ?nally sent his topmen aloft to reduce sail, although his signals to do the opposite remained on her halyards.<br><br> With frightening speed, the line enveloped the distant frigate. The ship heeled violently, almost onto her beam ends, as a brute force of wind slammed into her. Charles tried to calculate how long Louisa had before the storm caught her and decided it would be only a matter of moments at best. He stole a quick glance at Terpsichore, several cable lengths ahead, and at Bevan's brig, Pylades, a similar distance off the starboard bow. Both ships were hurriedly shortening canvas, Pylades already turning to present her bow to the onrushing gale.<br><br> "How long until the topgallant masts are on deck?" Charles yelled to Talmage across the strengthening wind.<br><br> "Only a minute, sir," the lieutenant called back. "There's some difficulty with the mizzen."<br><br> "Belay that; it'll have to do as it is," Charles shouted, an increasing note of urgency in his voi...</p><h2>The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze</h2><p>A definitive study of the Yangtze craft, complete with carefully detailed scale drawings, the result of the author&#39;s research and experience during his 30-year career as a river inspector in China.

France viewed this as a chance to seize Mexican territory in a moment they were convinced the Confederacy would prevail and take over Mexico. With both sides distracted in the U.S., this was their opportunity to seize territory in North America. In 1867, with aid from the United States, this movement came to a disastrous end both for the royals and for France while ushering in a new era for Mexico.<br><br>In a bid to oust Ju�rez, Mexican conservatives appealed to European leaders to select a monarch to run their country. Maximilian and Carlota&#x2019;s reign, from 1864 to 1867, was marked from the start by extravagance and ambition and ended with the execution of Maximilian by firing squad, with Carlota on the brink of madness. This epoch moment in the arc of French colonial rule, which spans North American and European history at a critical juncture on both continents, shows how Napoleon III&#x2019;s failure to save Maximilian disgusted Europeans and sealed his own fate.<br><br>Maximilian and Carlota offers a vivid portrait of the unusual marriage of Maximilian and Carlota and of international high society and politics at this critical nineteenth-century juncture. This largely unknown era in the history of the Americas comes to life through this colorful telling of the couple&#x2019;s tragic reign.<br></p><p><b>M. M.

He sounds like an Old West cowboy character; his voice is gravelly and terse. He makes the story so real one can smell the blood and sweat. It's 1881 in the Arizona Territory. The historic gunfight at the O.K. Corral has occurred, and the Earps and Doc Holliday have been arrested.

Most readers won't be able to sort out the dozens of characters until close to the end, which is a pity because Estleman, master of the hardboiled western (and mystery) story, has a terrific way of grabbing our attentionthe first sentence is a shockerand keeping us turning pages. The plot concerns the political and financial wranglings that ensued after the famous shoot-out (which was not in the O.K. Corral), an event that not only made Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers notorious but made them targets as well. Estleman displays solid historical knowledge and his usual deft writing.

In 1957, Lawrence began a weekly column for the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, blending gardening lore and horticultural expertise gained from her own gardens in Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina, and from her many gardener friends. This book presents 132 of her beloved columns. Never before published in book form, they were chosen from the more than 700 pieces that she wrote for the <i>Observer</i> over fourteen years.<p>Lawrence exchanged plants and gardening tips with everyone from southern &#x201c;farm ladies&#x201d; trading bulbs in garden bulletins to prominent regional gardeners. She corresponded with nursery owners, everyday backyard gardeners, and literary luminaries such as Katharine White and Eudora Welty. Her books, including <i>A Southern Garden</i>, <i>The Little Bulbs</i>, and <i>Gardens in Winter</i>, inspired several generations of gardeners in the South and beyond.</p><p>The columns in this volume cover specific plants, such as sweet peas, hellebores, peonies, and the bamboo growing outside her living-room window, as well as broader topics including the usefulness of vines, the importance of daily pruning, and organic gardening. Like all of Lawrence&#x2019;s writing, these columns are peppered with references to conversations with neighbors and quotations from poetry, mythology, and correspondence. They brim with knowledge gained from a lifetime of experimenting in her gardens, from her visits to other gardens, and from her extensive reading.</p><p>Lawrence once wrote, &#x201c;Dirty fingernails are not the only requirement for growing plants. One must be as willing to study as to dig, for a knowledge of plants is acquired as much from books as from experience.&#x201d; As inspiring today as when they first appeared in the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, the columns collected in <i>Beautiful at All Seasons</i> showcase not only Lawrence&#x2019;s vast knowledge but also her intimate, conversational writing style and her lifelong celebration of gardens and gardening.</p></p><p>"All gardeners will welcome this splendidly edited collection of essays by Elizabeth Lawrence.

All the ten year old Bowden knew about golf was that it was a stupid game that took up too much of his father&#x2019;s time, and that he&#x2019;d much rather kick around a soccer ball or stay home and read a book. But all that changed once Bowden&#x2019;s father, a renowned local doctor, introduced him to one of his patients, Freddie Bennett, the legendary Augusta National caddie master.<br><br> Though Bowden was a white child of considerable privilege and Bennett was an older black gentleman of more modest means, the two formed an unusual bond. It was Bennett who introduced Bowden to the game of golf, a sport that would one day earn him a Division 1 golf scholarship and lead him to the final stage of a British Open qualifier. But it was the lessons Bennett taught the young Bowden off the course that had their profoundest impact on his life. Through Freddie and his particular brand of homespun wisdom, the author learned invaluable lessons about personal responsibility, hard work, and respect for others regardless of age, race or religion. He also learned that there&#x2019;s much more to life than just playing golf.<br><br> Like the bestsellers <i>Tuesdays With Morrie</i> and <i>Seasons of Life</i> before it, <i>Freddie &amp; Me</i> is a heartwarming tale of two unlikely friends and their uncommon bond forged through sport.</p><p>Tripp Bowden is a former Augusta National caddy, the first full-time white caddy in the history of the elite private club. He&#x2019; s also a former collegiate golfer and alum of Augusta University and a former copywriter, first with McCann Erickson New York and later with his own company, Creative Wizards. Tripp is the author of the New York Times-praised Freddie &amp; Me: Life Lessons from Freddie Bennett, Augusta National&#x2019; s Legendary Caddy Master, and All the Memorable Rounds: Golf Adventures and Misadventures from Augusta National to Cypress Point and Beyond. A frequent speaker at prominent golf clubs and sports venues across America and beyond, Tripp lives with his wife Fletch and children Arrie B. and Holly Mac in Augusta, Georgia.A glimpse of Augusta National as you've never seen it.

A highly accomplished man, his was a life of note. Although now known by many chiefly as an author, he was also an historian, Unionist politican and Governor General of Canada. Although he stated that it was not strictly an autobiography, Memory Hold-the-Door provides a reflective, personal account of his childhood in Scotland, his literary work from his time at Oxford University to the famous Hannay and Leithen stories and his extensive public service in South Africa, Scotland, France in the Great War, and Canada. Of great interest are his accounts of key contemporary figures, including Lord Grey, Lord Haldane, Earl Balfour, Lord Haig, T.E. Lawrence and King George V.

He also discusses the significance of herbs and religious artifacts and objects and explains the roles and responsibilities of medicine men and other religious practitioners. <p>First written as a report for the Department of the Interior in 1963, <i>Wakinyan</i> has long been recognized as a classic study of Lakota religion.

As the Bride of Christ, the church is responsible for getting itself ready for the wedding of the Bridegroom. Revival is continually being poured out all around the earth and it is time for us as believers to invest in the intimacy which transforms our lives today and prepares our hearts for eternity. Whether you are a leader, a church member or a new believer, The Invitation will inspire you to to take practical steps today which are fundamental in preparing your heart for the Lord s return. Building a life of intimacy with God will bring transformation into every area of your life. There is no time left to be lukewarm. <br></p><p>John and Carol Arnott are the Founding Pastors and Presidents of Catch The Fire and oversee the Partners in Harvest network of churches. As international speakers, John and Carol have become known for their ministry on the Father's Love, where they have seen millions of lives touched and changed through encountering the Father's embrace and His incredible love for them. <br>One of the most challenging responsibilities in our lives as followers of Jesus is to be ready and longing for Jesus' return for His Bride, while at the same time having a vision that will take multiple generations to unfold. John and Carol Arnott model this tension perfectly and have now put it in their book, The Invitation. The task at hand of bringing light to dark places is great, and there is an urgency to be ready and full of the Holy Spirit. This book brings realignment to the reader to pursue the oil of intimacy, to be awakened to the hour in which we are living and to make an impact on the earth.

The 11-year-old joins him on a journey to the New World, serving as a page to Captain John Smith. Samuel&#39;s account of the voyage to Virginia, political intrigues among the settlers, and the harrowing first winter of the James Town settlement brings to life figures like Smith, Powhatan, and Pocahontas. Details about food and daily life add realism to the story, and quotes from historical sources begin each chapter. His initial selfishness changes as he responds to the reverend, to Smith, and to his new friends. His time in an Indian village and his changing perspectives on the Natives add interest to the story and depth to his character. While the opening chapters move slowly, the pace picks up as Samuel reaches Virginia. This title is a good choice for a tie-in with the 400th anniversary celebrations of Jamestown in 2007.</p><p></p><h2>Infortunios de Alonso Ramirez / The Misfortunes of Alonso Ramirez (1690): Annotated Bilingual Edition (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>In 2009, 319 years after its publication, and following over a century of copious scholarly speculation about the work, Jos� F. Buscaglia is the first scholar to furnish direct and irrefutable proof that the story contained in the&nbsp;<i>Infortunios/Misfortunes</i>&nbsp;is based on the life and times of a man certifiably named Alonso Ram�rez, who was shipwrecked on Herradura Point in the Coast of Yucat�n on Sunday September 18, 1689. This first bilingual edition of the&nbsp;<i>Infortunios/Misfortunes</i>&nbsp;reports the findings of almost two decades of sustained research in pursuit, on land and by sea, of a most elusive historical character who was, as we now can attest with all degree of certainty, the first American known to have circumnavigated the globe. Captured by pirates, shipwrecked, and eventually rescued and sent on his way, this is one man&#x2019;s story of his unanticipated voyage around the Early Modern world. With transcription, translation, notes, maps, images, and critical essay by Jose F.

Dobson</b>, Ph.D., is founder and chairman of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit organization that produces his internationally syndicated radio programs, heard by more than 200 million people every day. He is seen on 80 television stations daily in the U.S. A licensed psychologist and licensed marriage, family, and child counselor, he is a clinical member of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy and is listed in Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare. Dr. Dobson is married to Shirley and is the father of two grown children, Danae and Ryan. He resides in Colorado.Psychologist Dobson is one of the most successful--and because of his adamancy on the sinfulness of abortion and homosexuality, most controversial--Christian broadcasters via his daily program,<i> Focus on the Family</i>. On the strength of that success, Word is ordering a quarter-million-copy first printing of this adviser on love and life for young adults age 16 to 26. Full of personal anecdotes and great swatches of text from Dobson's previous books, presented in a congenial, colloquial manner like that of Dobson's speeches and radio commentary, it is basically sound, commonsensical, albeit stringent counsel. Dobson is foursquare for delaying sex until marriage, choosing a spouse carefully, and dismissing divorce as a way to solve problems. He admonishes his target audience to be faithful to their families of origin despite the stresses caused by the necessity of achieving adult independence, and he advocates Christian rather than state or private secular colleges for undergraduate education. Undergirding these major themes are a pretty fundamentalist Christianity, to be sure, but also a genuine counselor's understanding of human weakness and extension of sympathy. And despite the bad rap the Religious Right, of which Dobson is a prominent voice, gets, there is not a hateful word in the book. Convinced young Christians, especially those who don't fancy themselves sophisticated, well may appreciate Dobson's manner as well as his matter. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Inklings: C.S.Lewis, J.R.R.Tolkien, Charles Williams and Their Friends</h2><p>Drawing on unpublished letters and diaries, the author examines the friendship between and the social and literary gatherings of Lewis, Tolkien, and Williams who laughingly called themselves the Inklings</p><p>HUMPHREY CARPENTER (1946-2005) was a prolific biographer and a highly entertaining broadcaster for BBC Radio.

He teaches Renaissance studies at Birkbeck College. He is thirty-three and lives in London.<br>Once Sir Philip Sidney died of an infected thigh wound in 1586 at 31, myth-making forces went to work. We know Sidney now as a courtier-poet cut down in his prime in a useless skirmish in the Netherlands and for giving his water to a dying soldier on the battlefield an incident that never happened, says British historian Stewart (coauthor of Hostage to Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon). This man, known as the "epitome of Elizabethan chivalry" and "quintessential Englishman," appears here as disappointingly less than his reputation. The subtitular "double life" alludes to the fact that the handsome, talented, well-born Sir Philip was belittled and neglected in England by status-sensitive, conspiracy-minded Queen Elizabeth, while on the continent his poetry and his statesmanship earned him acclaim. Except for the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572 in Paris, which he most likely witnessed, there was little drama in his life until the small war in which he was mortally wounded. Stewart furnishes a litany of Sidney's frustrations (his connections to noble families under royal suspicion injured his prospects), and examines his literary projects, which, but for the convoluted pastoral epic Arcadia, the lofty Defense of Poesie and the sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella, remained unfinished. In Stewart's demythologized study, Sidney is the prisoner of his birthright. It is ironic that, because of his death, his less-talented younger brother Robert became Earl of Leicester and built a London mansion (which gave its name to Leicester Square), for which he is more widely remembered than his more accomplished older brother. Scrupulously researched but a bit sluggish in pace, this biography will appeal to fans of Elizabethan England.

But what a treat it is for hikers seeking solitude.<br> From the trailhead, follow the path as it merges into a wide farm road. You'll soon pass an open field to the left. There's a cornfield straight ahead where, at 0.1 mile, you'll come to the first split. Head left to stay on the yellow-blazed Barley Pond Loop. Follow the tree line around the cornfield, turning right at a "You are here" sign at 0.3 miles and reaching the edge of the woods at 0.6 miles. There's a wooden sign here reading, "The woods were made for the hunter of dreams." There are many spots along the hike where similar signs have been painted with inspirational, nature-oriented quotations. There's a certain irony here: though the quotations are pleasant, this hike is so beautiful that it's the last place that needs any embellishment. The views are plenty to inspire grand thoughts. <br><br></p><h2>Life and Holiness</h2><p>In this brief and readily accessible work, Merton offers his thoughts on what it means to be holy in the face of the anxieties of the modern world.</p><p>f and readily accessible work, Merton offers his thoughts on what it means to be holy in the face of the anxieties of the modern world.Thomas Merton (1915-1968), Trappist monk, author, and peacea activist, came to international prominence at a young age with his classic autobiography, <i>The Seven Story Mountain</i>.

After all, Donovan had once done the favor for her (in <i>Up Jim River</i>). There is a struggle in the Lion's Mouth, the bureau that oversees the Shadows&#x2015;a clandestine civil war of sabotage and assassination between those who would overthrow Those of Name and the loyalists who support them.

It begins.</i><br>The scarred man awoke muzzy-headed in a dark, close room, confused at where he was, and tangled in wires and tubes. The last clear thing in the jumbled closets of his mind was his buying of a ticket to Dangchao Waypoint, and for a fuddled moment he wondered if he might be within that very ship, already on his way.<br>But if so, he was grossly cheated, for he had purchased third-class fare on a Hadley liner and, of the many things his present accommodations were not, a third-class cabin on a Hadley liner was one. The room was barely large enough to contain the thin, hard bunk on which he lay and, when that bunk had been stowed into the wall, the room grew paradoxically smaller: a pace and a half one way; two and a half the other. It was the half pace that galled.<br>It was a room for keeping prisoners.<br>&#x201c;Fool,&#x201d; said the Fudir, once he had removed the catheters and intravenous feeding tubes that spiderlike had webbed him in his cot. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been shanghaied.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long were we asleep?&#x201d; Donovan asked.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>There is this one thing that you must know about the scarred man; or rather, nine things. It is not his hooked chin, nor his sour humors, nor even the scars that interlace his scalp and leave his preternaturally whitened hair in tufts. It is that he is &#x201c;a man of parts,&#x201d; and those parts are the pieces of his mind, shattered like a mirror and rearranged to others&#x2019; whims. It is in the nature of the intellect to reflect upon things; and so a mirror is the proper metaphor, but the scarred man&#x2019;s reflections are more kaleidoscopic than most.<br>The singular benefit of paraperception is that the paraperceptic can see different objects with each eye, hear independently with each ear, and quite often the right hand knows not what the left is doing. This has advantages; and would have had more had the scarred man&#x2019;s masters not been ambitious or cruel.<br>Early in Donovan&#x2019;s service to the Confederation, the Secret Name had gifted him with a second personality, the Fudir, which enabled him to live masqueraded as a petty thief in the Terran Corner of Jehovah while Donovan ran Particular Errands for Those of Name. But if two heads are better than one, ten heads must be better than two, and the Names had later, after Donovan had displeased Them in some small matter of galactic domination, split his mind still further. They had slivered his intellect and made of him something new: a para<i>con</i>ceptic, able not merely to perceive matters in parallel, but to conceive ideas in parallel. This was the ambition.<br>It was also the cruelty. They had imprinted each fragment with a complete, if rudimentary, personality, expert in some particular facet of the Espionage Art. The intent had been to create a team of specialists; though the consequence had been instead a quarrelsome committee. For the hand that split his intellect had misstruck; and the blow had split his will as well.<br>Though perhaps the blow had been true, deliberate, a part of his punishment. Perhaps at the last Those of Name had flinched from the prospect of too great a success. Those had made an art of punishment, and the connoisseurs among Them would often contemplate the intricacies of a punitive masterwork with something close to aesthetic joy. &#x201c;Kaow�n,&#x201d; they called it. The scarred man had been conceived initially as a human weapon. But who would build such a weapon without a catch?<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>&#x201c;Fool,&#x201d; said the Fudir. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been shanghaied.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long were we asleep?&#x201d; Donovan asked.<br>I&#x2019;m not sure, replied the Silky Voice. I seemed to fight the drugs forever.<br>The Pedant rumbled and blinked gray, watery eyes. If asleep, no more than three days. If suspended, as long as three weeks.<br>The Sleuth eyed the life-support equipment from which they had so recently disengaged. <i>We were in suspension</i> he deduced, <i>not asleep.</i><br>That could be. Suspension would affect even me, back here in the hypothalamus.<br> remembered Inner Child. <br>Yeah? said the Brute. And where was you? You&#x2019;re supposed to be the lookout.<br>Now is not the time for recriminations, a young man wearing a chlamys told them. We must start from where we are, not from where we might have been.<br>The Brute grunted, unmollified. He tried the door, found the jamb-plate inactive, and struck it in several likely places. Donovan did not expect it to open, and so was not disappointed when it failed to do so. A young girl in a chiton squatted nearby on her haunches, her arms wrapped around her legs and her chin resting on her knees. We can get out of here, she said.<br>Donovan turned control over to the Sleuth, who went to their knees for a closer study of the jamb.<br>The Pedant recognized the locking mechanism from his databank. A Yarbor and Chang lock. This ship is Peripheral-built.<br>&#x201c;Probably hijacked by our gracious hostess,&#x201d; muttered the Fudir.<br>Which means this room was not <i>designed</i> as a prison cell, said the girl in the chiton, whom Donovan liked to call &#x201c;Pollyanna.&#x201d;<br><i>So. Retrofitted ad hoc,</i> said the Sleuth, <i>and likely in haste. Yarbor and Chang&nbsp;... so what?</i><br>Its central processor has a design flaw. A notice went out from their corporate headquarters on Gladiola two metric years ago. I remember reading it.<br><i>You remember everything,</i> the Sleuth complained. He took the scarred man&#x2019;s right arm and pointed. <i>Pedant&#x2019;s design flaw indicates that an electrical current passed across these two points&#x2014;here, and here&#x2014;will set up a magnetic field within the processor that resets the lock to zero.</i><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; said the Fudir. &#x201c;So if we had a generator in our pocket, or a battery, and some wires, and could maybe do a bit of soldering, if we had a soldering gun&#x2014;and some solder&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a chance we could get out of this room.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;At which point,&#x201d; said Donovan, &#x201c;we would find ourselves in a ship. A bigger cell, is all.&#x201d;<br>Hey. At least we&#x2019;d have room to stretch.<br>&#x201c;And where would we find wiring?&#x201d;<br><br><i>And it&#x2019;s not pitch dark in here.</i><br>He means there is a power source.<br>&#x201c;I know what he means. Sleuth always has to be clever and elliptical.&#x201d;<br>When he ain&#x2019;t bein&#x2019; obtuse! The Brute laughed.<br>That the Brute was making obscure geometric puns irritated Donovan. Sometimes he didn&#x2019;t know his own mind. Ever since his sundry selves had reintegrated, they had been learning from one another. The Brute was no longer quite so simple as he once had been; though it was not as though he had blossomed into the New Socrates.<br>The Fudir climbed atop the bunk, studied the Eye, unscrewed a housing with <i>a convenient tool</i> he kept cached in his sandal, detached the live leads&#x2014;<i>See? We didn&#x2019;t need a power source</i>&#x2014;and pulled the cable, while simultaneously Donovan and the others considered what they might do once they had broken free of their prison.<br>&#x201c;Take over the ship, I suppose,&#x201d; Donovan said. &#x201c;Slide to Dangchao Waypoint. See M�arana&nbsp;... and Bridget ban.&#x201d;<br><br>Don&#x2019;t matter.<br>&#x201c;Well, it might, a little.&#x201d;<br><i>I wonder why she shanghaied us,</i> said the Sleuth.<br>The lamp that was lit has been lit again.<br>What&#x2019;s that mean, Silky?<br>Something she said. Something I remember from a dream. Pedant? You remember everything.<br>The corpulent, watery-eyed version of Donovan shook his massive head. Facts are my m�tier, not dreams.<br>The Fudir applied the leads from the Eye to the doorjamb, one above, the other below the point that the Pedant had identified. <i>This ought to work,</i> the Sleuth commented.<br>Of course it will, said the girl in the chiton.<br>Current flowed. Magnetic fields formed. Somewhere inside the door, registers zeroed out and reset.<br>Or were supposed to. The door remained shut.<br>The Brute stood and, perforce, they all stood with him. He pressed the jamb-plate&#x2014;and the door slid aside into the wall. The scarred man felt a huge satisfaction.<br> warned Inner Child, who took control and peered cautiously into the corridor. To the left it ran four paces, ending in a T-intersection.<br>To the right&nbsp;...<br>To the right stood Ravn Olafsdottr with a teaser in her hand and a splash of white teeth across her coal-black face. The teaser was pointed at Donovan&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Ooh, you nooty buoy,&#x201d; she said in the hooting accents of Alabaster. &#x201c;Soo impatient! I wood have let you oot in the ripeness of time. Now you have brooken my door!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You should stop somewhere for repairs, then,&#x201d; suggested the Fudir. &#x201c;I was on my way to Dangchao, so you can drop me off on Die Bold if you&#x2019;re going that way.&#x201d;<br>Olafsdottr patted him gently on the cheek with her free hand. &#x201c;You are a foony man, Doonoovan.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Olafsdottr fashioned him a dinner of sorts.

Drawing upon scriptural accounts of the early church, he demonstrates the Christian community's constant need for reform and change. Yoder first examines the scriptural and theoretical foundations of Christian social ethics. While personally committed to the "radical reformation" tradition, he eschews "denominational" categorization and addresses Christians in general. The status of Christian community, he argues, cannot be separated from the doctrinal content of beliefs and the moral understanding of discipleship. As a result, the Christian's voluntary commitment to a particular community, as distinct from secular society, offers him valuable resources for practical moral reasoning. From a historical perspective, Yoder reviews the efforts of sixteenth-century radical (or Anabaptist) reformers to return to the fundamental ethical standards of the New Testament, and to disengage the community, as a biblically rooted call to faith that does not imply withdrawal from the pluralistic world. Rather, radical commitment to Christianity strengthens and renews the authentic human interests and values of the whole society. His analyses of democracy and of civil religion illustrate how Christianity must challenge and embrace the wider world.<br></p><p><br><b>John Howard Yoder</b> was Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame until his death in 1999.

Cheese making was a family affair where cheeses of all kinds could be purchased from local farmers and made fresh in the kitchen. Recipes were handed down through the generations like heirlooms. Cheese making was not just a convenient way to store the nutrition from surplus milk; it was an art form in itself. Unfortunately, the Industrial Revolution all but exterminated these traditions as millions moved to cities and the left their cheese recipes behind. It takes just as much time to make three pounds of cheese in a kitchen as it does to make 3,000 pounds in a factory. In an age of efficiency, the factories won by churning out tons of processed cheese. </p><p>This book will introduce you to the delicious world of homemade cheeses.

Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.</p>The Scottish Highlands that Beaton depicts with such skill are beautiful and sinister, a fitting backdrop to her Hamish Macbeth series and especially to this one, her twenty-sixth craggy-cozy. The mystery centers in the tiny Highlands village of Drim, &#x201c;a huddle of white-washed cottages&#x201d; on the banks of a sea loch, where mountains rise up at water&#x2019;s edge. There, the body of the posh new owner of a long-abandoned estate is found, stuffed up the chimney. The chimney sweep himself, who was to have been cleaning the estate chimney, is found dead on the motorway, an apparent accident victim, a few hours later. The local police feel the case is open and shut, with the chimney sweep tabbed as the murderer of the estate owner, until Constable Hamish Macbeth questions the findings, even of the forensics team. Someone has embarked on a spree, starting at the estate, and spreading to Edinburgh. Great stuff, as usual. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>Biggles and the blue moon</h2><p>Spine creased, foxing to tanned page edges.

William Blum shows us how, even though Clinton calls America the worlds greatest force for peace, our Rogue State really needs to be leashed.</p>William Blum left the State Department in 1967, abandoning his aspiration of becoming a Foreign Service Officer because of his opposition to what the US was doing in Vietnam.

Mr Blum has been a freelance journalist in the US, Europe and South America. His stay in Chile in 1972-3, writing about the Allende government&#39;s &#39;socialist experiment&#39;, and then its tragic overthrow in a CIA-designed coup, instilled in him a personal involvement and an even more heightened interest in what his government was doing in various corners of the world.

Some of today&#39;s scientists, in particular quantum physicists, are doing the same. In his latest contribution to the study of consciousness, physicist Fred Alan Wolf reveals what he calls the new alchemy a melding of the ideas of the old alchemists and the new scientists to reach a fuller understanding of the mind and matter.</p><p>Fred Alan Wolf earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from UCLA and has taught at San Diego State University as well as the University of London, the University of Paris, the HahnMeitner Institute for Nuclear Physics in Berlin, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In addition to being featured in What the Bleep, Fred Alan Wolf is a frequent radio guest and has appeared on television programs such as the Discovery Channel&#39;s The Know Zone (as the resident physicist) and PBS&#39;s Closer to Truth. He is also a member of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Collegium of Scholars, winner of the National Book Award, and the author of nine books including Mind into Matter, Matter into Feeling, and The Spiritual Universe."How refreshing to have a scientist put the emphasis on the individualwhere it belongs!

This tribal connection has been largely lost in modern society, but regaining it may be the key to our psychological survival. <br> Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today. <br> Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that-for many veterans as well as civilians-war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world. <br></p><p>"Thought-provoking...a gem."

Edited by Alfred W. McCoy and Francisco A. Scarano, the essays in this volume show how the challenge of ruling such far-flung territories strained the U.S. state to its limits, creating both the need and the opportunity for bold social experiments not yet possible within the United States itself. Plunging Washington&#x2019;s rudimentary bureaucracy into the white heat of nationalist revolution and imperial rivalry, colonialism was a crucible of change in American statecraft. From an expansion of the federal government to the creation of agile public-private networks for more effective global governance, U.S. empire produced far-reaching innovations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving well beyond theory, this volume takes the next step, adding a fine-grained, empirical texture to the study of U.S. imperialism by analyzing its specific consequences. Across a broad range of institutions&#x2014;policing and prisons, education, race relations, public health, law, the military, and environmental management&#x2014;this formative experience left a lasting institutional imprint. With each essay distilling years, sometimes decades, of scholarship into a concise argument, <i>Colonial Crucible</i> reveals the roots of a legacy evident, most recently, in Washington&#x2019;s misadventures in the Middle East.<br></p><p>Alfred W.

Original.</p><p>Little's first full-length novel since last year's The Association is clogged with faceless characters and smothered by a preposterous story line involving ancient Indian burial grounds and frizzy-haired mummies. While many of Little's novels focus on the darkness of the human psyche with only touches of the paranormal, this one is too supernatural for its own good. The plot, which is far-fetched even by Little's standards, hinges on a team of archeologists who unearth a series of bizarre finds in Springerville, Ariz. Soon humans and animals are inexplicably slaughtering one another, and others are vanishing into thin air. At the plot's core is the so-called Mogollon Monster, a hideous half-human, half-animal that seemingly dictates the chaos. The fact that all of the main characters happen to be immune to the creature, as if they are chosen ones, requires an even greater suspension of disbelief. Although Little may be trying to make some sweeping statement about human nature or modern society with this book, the effect is lost in a haze of dense plotting, undeveloped characters and sickening scenes that are present more to shock than to advance the story.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.A waking nightmare.

Now in a majestic, outsized volume, Sloane presents an autobiography, a recollection, an album of stunning artwork, a passionate remembrance of the American landscape, and an outspoken defense of our threatened natural heritage. Half a century ago, Sloane, then an itinerant sign painter, set out to see America. The 37 oil paintings in this book depict the landscapes, the villages, the houses - indeed, the spirit of that time; they are vintage Sloane, classic Americana. But in addition to the powerful charm and nostalgia of his recollection, Sloane also presents en passant a report on the decaying American environment - both physical and cultural - and a lament for what we as a people have lost, wasted, or denied. The paintings in this book make a complete art show, which is expected to tour the country as a vivid reminder of our natural heritage.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Gravelight</h2><p>Wycherly Musgrave doesn't have good luck with cars and alcohol.

In the wake of these trailblazers followed those whose purpose it was to take this land and hold it; it was they who had named the place of their settlement Morton's Fork, after a churchman's judgment whose unfairness still rankled after generations.<br>Through the 1700s and into the nineteenth century the town flourished after its fashion, until coal was found in the West Virginia hills, coal enough to fuel a young nation's expansion--if only it could be harvested from the bones of the mountains in which it lay. And so the mining companies moved into the West Virginia mountains, bringing wealth and despotism, poverty and hope, and changing the landscape and the people forever. The corporations that owned the coal did not care how lavishly it spent men, or at what cost to the future the coal was harvested.<br>Morton's Fork was strangely unaffected by the wildcat growth of company towns and mine-heads that transformed and destroyed other communities; what coal the mountains of Lyonesse County held was too poor and scant to attract the attention of the Eastern robber barons. Those men who worked the mines traveled miles to do it: Morton's Fork itself slumbered on. And when the time of coal was past, the big corporations left nothing in their wake but a desolation and blight greater than their presence had caused, but Morton's Fork remained unchanged.<br>Four great wars did little more than the mines had to change the lives of the people who lived in those hills; in 1914, on the eve of America's entrance into the European War, there was a sanatorium built in the hills above Morton's Fork, and more than a decade later a WPA road-building project left behind a cluster of cabins that imposed a false uniformity upon the wild Appalachians. Then the world moved on, and in its wake the isolated hamlet of Morton's Fork slid back into its decades-long sleep, willing to dream the rest of the twentieth century away as it had slumbered through the nineteenth, and the eighteenth.<br>Neither radio nor television disturbed these sheltering hills with their rambling cover of pine and birch and laurel. The nearest library was twelve miles away, the nearest supermarket, twenty. There was no FedEx nor MTV to interrupt the even tenor of the passing days.<br>It was a good place to hide.<br>* * *<br>He had been driving all night, and now, several hours past dawn, the view through the convertible's windshield alternated between sharp-cut valleys still filled with July-morning mist and the abrupt darkness of pine-covered mountainsides; coal country, as beautiful and uncharitable as a rich man's daughter. Each time the car swung to follow the road, the assortment of bottles lying on their sides in the passenger footwell clanged together with a high sweet sound, and he found himself hoping one of them would break and spill. As a parched man dreams of water in the desert, he wanted to smell the liquor. It was the only constant in his life, and it had taken everything he had so eagerly given it.<br>Despite the craving, he hadn't opened any of the bottles yet. Perhaps he would. Perhaps a drink or two--or three--would make the highway beneath his wheels more challenging.<br>His name was Wycherly Ridenow Musgrave, and at the moment he had only the faintest idea where he was. Somewhere west of New York, he knew that much, but the days he'd spent behind the wheel of the little foreign car had blurred into a mosaic of road signs seen by moonlight and sunrises that revealed odd and unfamiliar landscapes. He was not lost. To be lost required a destination, and Wycherly Musgrave had none.<br>The dawn chill windstream pulled his coppery hair--too long; it made his father furious to see it--straight back from his forehead, and inside his expensive leather coat he shivered, but Wycherly was unwilling to stop driving even long enough to put up the Ferrari's top. If he were not driving he would have to do something else, and he didn't want to do something else. He wanted the road to be everything, to blot out thought, to destroy time.<br>There was an unmarked turnoff ahead. He jerked the wheel left to take it, fighting the wheel as the car slewed back and forth across the narrow road. The low-slung car responded gallantly, its racing engine skirling in protest as Wycherly downshifted and gunned it. The road was barely wide enough for it; Wycherly wondered briefly what he'd do if he met another vehicle, but it never occurred to him to slow down. He took a certain satisfaction from his easy mastery of the fast car on the difficult road; a symbol of competence in a life that normally had none. The car swerved. The bottles clanged. One of them would have to break soon.<br><i>Broken. All broken. Nothing left</i>. The thought gave Wycherly perverse pleasure. Everything was broken now, and it was Winter who had broken it. Winter Musgrave, his perfect trophy sister, who had launched the blow that set the Musgrave family spinning like a burst pi�ata. The golden girl had failed, and as if her failure were a magic dagger, the web of family and privilege and <i>not getting caught</i> that the Winters and the Musgraves and the Ridenows had spun round themselves for more than a century was rent asunder, and everything began to unravel.<br>For a moment the Ferrari drifted slyly to the right; the wheel--as Wycherly yanked it in the opposite direction--turning with frightening freedom beneath his hands. Then the wheels found the road surface again, and bit, and held. The car snapped back along the curve of the narrow road as if it were a greyhound after a rabbit, and Wycherly's mind drifted free of the present once more.<br>He didn't understand most of what had happened to the Musgrave family in the last year, but he did know that last fall Kenneth Jr.--petted, pampered, perfect Kenny--had finally committed some banker's crime that the authorities had taken notice of. Now the young prince--the aging, bloated, deteriorating prince, Wycherly emended viciously--had lost his Wall Street throne and his Wall Street salary. He and his perfect Patricia had been forced to give up all their expensive privileges and move home to Wychwood, living off his parents' charity, and the legal bills yet to come would put even more of a strain on the family finances.<br>At the same time--as if money had been his lifeblood in truth--the Musgrave patriarch, Kenneth Sr., had fallen gravely ill, a series of strokes knocking him from his Jovian throne and forcing him to retreat to Wychwood as a wounded animal would seek the shelter of its cave. Now the Musgrave patriarch was a ruined colossus, his remaining lifespan a thing to be measured in months.<br>Father was dying.<br>And Wycherly had fled. Because he needed--Because he needed--<br>He needed to know if he was supposed to die, too, and no one at Wychwood would tell him that. In the Musgrave family, facts were often a matter of opinion, and all the Musgraves were good at keeping secrets.<br>Echoes of fear and anger made him press harder on the accelerator, and the convertible was going much too fast for the road when it shot over the crest of the hill. For a moment it hung weightless and tractionless upon the air. Wycherly, not understanding had happened, ground the pedal harder into the floor: When the car struck the ground again, the forward thrust caught him by surprise, and in that fatal moment of inattention the car slewed right instead of left--away from the road entirely.<br>There wasn't even a guardrail.<br>Wycherly felt the car's wheels leave the pavement again, and instead of the brief hang time, this time the sensation went on and on. In the brief moment of weightless fall there came a menacing sense of peace, and then the implacable reality of thrust and gravity.<br>Impact came an instant before he expected it, swift and vicious as the executioner's blade.<br>* * *<br>In the days when Morton's Fork had been a flourishing community, this building had been a schoolhouse, and even now its red brick walls preserved something of that past. But now the building possessed both electricity and running water instead of a wood stove and outhouse; expensive modern furniture mingled with the charming country antiques that had replaced the blackboard and the rows of desks, and the spacious great room that had been created within the shell of the one room schoolhouse was encircled on three sides by a living loft. Antique stained glass replaced all the ground-floor windows, as if the person who had made this place had a more than ordinary need for privacy, even in this enchanted, isolated place.<br>Her name was Melusine Dellon--Sinah to her friends, "Melly" to those who wanted to pretend to know her well. The first group had never been large, but the second was growing bigger every day.<br>At this exact moment, Sinah was "almost famous," meaning that while she was already more well-known than most people became over the course of their lives, so far it was only to a small group of people--Broadway producers, theater critics, casting agents. This December that select circle would widen to every person in the world who could turn on, download, or read the news, when Castle Rock Films released <i>Zero Sum Game</i>, the film adaptation of Ellis Gardner's successful Broadway play. On December 18, Sinah Dellon would make the jump from moderately-well-known Broadway actress to certified Hollywood star.<br>And instead of being on the Coast, working her career, she was here.<br>Sinah looked around the room. If she were a proper movie star, Sinah supposed, she would be traveling with an entourage, and have a personal assistant to see to the business of unearthing experts and persuading them to explain things to her. But the Hollywood fast track seemed so...overblown, in comparison with its opposite number back East. Or, as <i>Variety</i> still referred to it, "<i>Legitimate</i> theater."<br>But Hollywood, once taken up, was not so easily dropped. There was a magic in being in front of the camera, in filtering out everyone else's emotions to concentrate on the director, taking from him, feeding him, searching for that addictive moment of transcendence.<br>She wondered if that was such a healthy thing to want, really. But if it wasn't, Sinah didn't know what other kind of life to wish for. The thought of turning back to the beginning and starting over again as a stockbroker or a marine biologist was something she couldn't even imagine. She was what she was.<br>A <i>freak</i>. Who had turned her freakish, unnatural empathy into a fast track in the dramatic arts, and now, like the lady who went for a ride on a tiger, she wasn't quite sure how to get out of the situation.<br>With a sigh, Sinah flung down the copy of <i>Variety</i> she'd been pretending to read and rubbed her temples, at last acknowledging the headache she'd been fighting all day. All around her, the home she had made mocked her with the memories of the haven she'd thought it would be. From the moment she'd come to Morton's Fork, everything had gone wrong--as if now, at last, it was time to pay for all the undeserved good fortune that had followed her for all her twenty-eight years of life.<br>God help her, she'd thought becoming an actress would solve her problems, not make them worse--and it had been so easy...<br>On her eighteenth birthday she'd boarded the bus for New York. Unlike so many other hopefuls, her time waiting tables was mercifully brief. Within six months Sinah was working steadily, though it would be another five years before her first starring role. Then she'd been cast in <i>Zero Sum Game</i>, which had run for almost two years before it had been sold to Hollywood, and Jason Kennedy--its star--had been part of the package, signed to recreate his role for the movie. Jason had possessed clout enough to specify that Sinah was a part of the deal, too.<br>Everyone had told her it was a stroke of luck, but she'd known it would happen from the moment the negotiations began. Melusine Dellon had been the very best at what she did for so long that praise had become another form of abuse--because the praise wasn't for <i>her</i>, or for anything she did, but for a simple freak of nature. She <i>was</i> Adrienne, just as she'd been Juliet, Maggie the Cat, Antigone, Hedda Gabler. Sinah was always perfect for the role.<br>Each role. Every role. Any role. Except, it seemed, the one of daughter.<br>On August 14, 1969, Athanais Dellon, of Morton's Fork, West Virginia, had given birth to Melusine Dellon, father unknown, and died. Sinah had the documents; she'd trusted the information implicitly. But when at long last she'd come home to reclaim her history, everyone here in Morton's Fork said Athanais Dellon had never existed.<br>It really didn't matter if her expectations of being welcomed had been unrealistic. When she'd arrived to take possession of her rebuilt school-house, Sinah had felt as if she'd walked into an episode of <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. There were no Dellons in Morton's Fork, people said. No one named Athanais Dellon had ever lived here. It would have been easy to write the whole thing off to stiff-necked rural pride, except that there was more to it than that. They were lying. Lying to her, hating her, trying to drive her down into madness and darkness; Sinah Dellon knew that better than she knew her own--reclaimed--name.<br>If she'd been smart she would have let matters slide right then, maybe even gone away again. But Sinah had always been a fighter--she'd announced herself to be Athanais' daughter and dared them to go on with their lies.<br>So they'd shut her out, and left her to her lonely splendor here in this wild beautiful place. Just as her foster parents had. Just as everyone who knew the truth about her did.<br>She didn't want to think about that, but what else was there to think about? Losing her mind? Dying? The taint in her blood--the monstrous gift that her dead mother must have shared, else how could the local people hate her so?<br>The carefully crafted social mask that Sinah wore even while alone crumbled, and she groped for a tissue to blot away the sudden, aching tears. <i>Tainted blood</i>. It sounded like the title of a cheap thriller, but it was the truth she'd fought against acknowledging all these years. Normal people couldn't do what Sinah Dellon could.<br>Normal people couldn't read minds.<br>* * *<br>She'd never known a time when she couldn't do it: the baby in the crib, absorbing its foster mother's thoughts and feelings with her touch; the schoolgirl with the answer to every test, who knew all her classmates' secrets--and told them, before she'd learned better. The word for what she was existed only in books, not in the real world.<br>Telepath. Mind reader. <i>Filthy prying snooping freak no daughter of mine monster</i>--Sinah choked back a sob. She'd prayed for the gift to leave her, but it had only gotten stronger as she'd gotten older, until she didn't need to touch someone to read his or her mind, though touch brought the sharpest images. With her gift, she could be anyone's d...</p><h2>Cogan&#39;s Trade</h2><p><p><b>A crime masterpiece brought back into print - and transformed into the major film, Killing Them Softly, starring Brad Pitt.</b></p><p>Jackie Cogan doesn't advertise what he does.

Works by Vermeer, Manet, and Whistler are featured alongside those of Edward Hopper and photographer Eve Arnold, among many others. Each image is accompanied by a commentary explaining the context in which it was created - who the reader is, her relationship with the artist, and what she is reading.</p><p>Stefan Bollman is writer and editor, and the author of several books. Karen Joy Fowler is the author of six books, including &#39;Sarah Canary, Sister Noon&#39; and the bestselling &#39;The Jane Austen Book Club&#39;.Women in crisp white frocks, extravagant gowns, and nary a stitch read books in gardens, at tables, and in bed, each utterly enthralled and transported. Beginning in the Middle Ages and sweeping forward to include paintings by Vermeer, Fragonard, Vuillard, and Hopper, Bollman has gathered arresting portraits of women entranced by books in all sorts of circumstances. Best-selling novelist Karen Joy Fowler provides a stirring foreword, in which she muses over how hard women had to fight for the right to literacy and the freedom to read. A woman reading, after all, is a woman not cooking or cleaning. Bollman further explicates the obstacles reading women faced when reading was considered more of a vice than a virtue for females. Providing shrewd and entertaining commentary for each heart-lifting image of women in book-induced reveries, Bollman covers a delectably wide spectrum of book-struck women, beginning with Simone Martini's 1333 <i>Annunciation</i>, in which Mary is clearly displeased at having her reading interrupted, and ending with an Eve Arnold photograph of Marilyn Monroe reading Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

"Kroeger's biography of Nellie Bly moves at almost as fast a pace as did Bly's remarkable life."--Mindy Spatt, San Francisco Chronicle. Photos &amp; illustrations.</p><p>She had herself committed to an insane asylum, circled the globe in 72 days, and worked as an elephant trainer, all for a good story. Nellie Bly (1864-1922) was the most famous female reporter of her day, and a pioneering businesswoman (she started the first steel-barrel manufacturing plant in the U.S.). Journalist Kroeger&#39;s formidably well-researched book, based on legal and archival material as well as Bly&#39;s more than 600 newspaper and magazine articles, paints a compelling portrait of a woman who learned early not to rely on men, yet coupled her can-do spirit with a vivacious femininity that endeared her to readers during a 37-year career.A meticulously researched, consistently entertaining biography of the legendary turn-of-the-century journalist whose true adventures far outstripped the boundaries of myth. For this first full-scale treatment of Bly, former United Press International reporter Kroeger reaches through a web of half- truths (many courtesy of the subject herself) and scanty facts to uncover the complex path of ``a life not so much lived as waged.'' Born near Pittsburgh in 1864, Elizabeth Jane Cochran began her career with an extraordinary stroke of luck--the editor of The Pittsburgh Dispatch, fascinated by her spirited letter rebuking a columnist who urged women to stay at home, gave the untrained 20- year-old a position and, in the fashion of the day, a catchy life- long pseudonym. But it was her own initiative that secured lasting fame. Deciding to scale the walls of newspaper capital New York, with her sights set on Joseph Pulitzer's splashy The World, Bly quickly became a leading investigative reporter in a business still largely closed to women. National celebrity came with an effort to better Jules Verne's fictional Phileas Fogg by going around the world in 75 days. Her relentlessly self-referential but charming and uninhibited style made Bly, in Kroeger's estimation, perhaps the first ``gonzo'' journalist. Reborn as an enlightened manufacturer after a curious elopement with a millionaire industrialist 40 years her senior, Bly mastered technology sufficiently to pick up 25 patents in her own name. Financial ruin drew the now-widowed Bly to Austria to report from the front lines of WW I, and a final foray into New York journalism, just prior to her death at 57, cast Bly as a passionate advocate for downtrodden women and children. While skillfully conveying the outlines of an astounding life, Kroeger, hampered by a lack of intimate detail, never manages to make Bly a fully three-dimensional character- -although, as she amply demonstrates, four or five dimensions would seem more appropriate. Inspiring reading for those searching out a feminist role model--or just a breathless ride through an incredible life.

(American Girls Series). CIP. Pleasant. 1987. PSm $12.95; pap. $5.95. Grade 1-5 Yes, the American Girls series is written to formula, and yes, it is heavily promoted commercialy to sell dolls and related accessories. But the dolls are well crafted and so are the stories. Each book ends with several pages of illustrated factual ``Looking Backward'' information. The writing style is lively, the characters believable although not deeply delineated, and the action in the short chapters is enough to hold the attention of young readers. The birth of Kirsten's baby sister and the making of a friendship quilt along with her tenth birthday party at a barn-raising are the major events of Kirsten's story, set in Minnesota in 1854. The discussion of the dangers of tornadoes and the high mortality of infants in those days add serious notes to the generally happy tale. Samantha's fancy tenth birthday party in 1904 is followed by a trip to New York City and a wild chase after a mischievous puppy, ending at a suffragette meeting. Molly changes her romantic view of wartime England and faces reality when an evacuated British girl her age comes to share her home and birthday. In all the volumes the easy-to-read type and the realistic color illustrations, both full-page and vignette, add to the attractiveness of these unintimidating volumes. Sylvia S.

But look again, and his meticulous, oversize renditions of toy trains, crystal bowls, ripened pears and oriental carpets are unmistakably rooted in the 20th century. This contemporary realist from Minnesota refers to his paintings as "reports" or "investigations," and, indeed, they are deep, sensuous meditations on the nature of external reality. At times their subject matterantique tables, strawberries on a doily, gourmet chocolatesseems carefully chosen to bespeak upper-middle-class comfort and domesticity. But their real value lies in the artist's quiet, penetrating gaze.

The haunting echo of my own footsteps followed me down the long, windowless corridor inside the maximum security wing of Florida State Prison in Starke. I&#x2019;d visited many prisons, and the smell was always the same: a choking mixture of piss, shit, fear, and desperation, wiped down by harsh antiseptics. Walking through an electronically operated steel door, I was pat�ted down by two stone-faced guards. Satisfied that I was not carry�ing weapons or contraband, they passed me off to a smirking inmate with a hideous purple birthmark on the side of his face. He took off at a brisk pace, and I followed him into the cellblock that housed death row inmates. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Garvin,&#x201d; he replied, not breaking stride. &#x201c;What are you in for?&#x201d; &#x201c;I shot up my family during Thanksgiving dinner.&#x201d; I walked past the cells in death row with my eyes to the floor, feel�ing their occupants&#x2019; presence like a fist pounding on my back. When we arrived at an empty cell, Garvin slid back the door, and stepped to one side. &#x201c;Wait inside here,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>&#x201c;What if no one comes?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Make some noise, and I&#x2019;ll come get you.&#x201d; <br><br>I entered the cell, a ten-by-ten concrete square with two wood benches anchored to the floor, and a small wood table. Garvin slammed the door behind me, making me jump. He chuckled as he walked away. <br><br>I took the bench nearest the door, and stuck a piece of gum into my mouth. I chewed so hard it made my jaw ache. I&#x2019;d put scores of bad guys into Starke, and I didn&#x2019;t want to be here any longer than I had to. <br><br>I stared at the table. Inmates were not supposed to have anything sharp, but the table said otherwise. Names and dates and ugly epi�thets were carved into every inch of wood. One name stood out over the others. <br><br><i>Abb Grimes <br></i><br>I had been involved in Abb&#x2019;s case, and I knew his story. A Fort Lauderdale native, he&#x2019;d quit high school at seventeen, done a stint in the navy, gotten married and had a kid, and gone to work driving a newspaper delivery truck&#x2013;an ordinary guy, except that he liked to kill young women. <br><br>Abb&#x2019;s killings followed a pattern. Late at night, he left his house, and walked to the neighborhood grocery. There, he&#x2019;d hidden behind the Dumpsters. When a young homeless woman would show up looking for food, he&#x2019;d drag her into the woods, rape and strangle her, then stuff her body in a large garbage bag, tossing her into a Dumpster. <br><br>As mass murders went, it was nearly perfect. The victims were women no one cared about, and the bodies were disposed of for him. It might have gone on forever, only one night a surveillance camera filmed Abb with the body of a victim draped in his arms. As was his custom, the store manager viewed the tape the next morn�ing. Seeing Abb, he called 911. <br><br>The police found the woman&#x2019;s body in the Dumpster. They got a search warrant for Abb&#x2019;s home and in his garage they found a card�board box containing women&#x2019;s underpants. Each of the pairs was different. <br><br>Their next stop was the Pompano Beach landfill, where trash in Broward County was taken. Using earth movers and cadaver dogs, they&#x2019;d moved several acres of trash, digging up the bodies of seven�teen strangled women. <br><br>Eleven of the women were carrying ID. As head of the Broward County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department&#x2019;s Missing Persons unit, it had been my job to contact their families. It had been one of the hardest things I&#x2019;d ever done. <br><br>The remaining six women were still Jane Does. I had hoped to identify them one day, and put their memories to rest. Only I&#x2019;d lost my job after beating up a suspect, and never gotten it done. <br><br>It ate at me. <br><br>Hearing footsteps, I went to the cell door. Wearing leg irons and handcuffs and flanked by two guards, Abb shuffled down the hall. Tall and powerfully built, he had an angular jaw and dark, deeply set eyes. During his trial, the prosecution had called him &#x201c;The Night Stalker,&#x201d; which had been a TV show that had lasted one season. It had scared the hell out of everyone who&#x2019;d seen it. The nickname fit. <br><br>&#x201c;Stand back,&#x201d; a guard ordered. <br><br>I retreated, and the three men entered. Abb dropped down on the opposing bench and looked at the floor, while the two guards re�mained standing. <br><br>An attractive brunette clutching a leather briefcase came in next. She was young and looked a little scared, and I found myself admir�ing her. It took guts for a woman to enter a prison filled with a thou�sand hardened criminals. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Piper Stone, Abb&#x2019;s attorney,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>&#x201c;Jack Carpenter,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for coming.&#x201d; <br><br>We sat on the bench, and faced Abb. As strange as it sounded, he was my client, so I waited for him to start. Abb cleared his throat. He had a voice like gravel, and I guessed he didn&#x2019;t use it much. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to die soon,&#x201d; Abb said. &#x201c;Did my lawyer tell you that?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, she didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to execute me in four days,&#x201d; Abb said. &#x201c;Think you can find my grandson before then?&#x201d; <br><br>Abb&#x2019;s grandson, three-year-old Sampson Grimes, had disap�peared from his bedroom three nights ago. I&#x2019;d read about it in the Fort Lauderdale newspapers, and knew that the police had been stymied in their efforts to locate him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to try,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Now, why don&#x2019;t you tell me what happened.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I get an hour each day to exercise in the yard,&#x201d; Abb said. &#x201c;Two days ago, a photograph of my grandson and a ransom note got slipped into my back pocket. I didn&#x2019;t see who did it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Do you still have the note and photo?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I gave them to Ms. Stone.&#x201d; <br><br>I looked at Stone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see them.&#x201d; <br><br>Stone unclasped her briefcase and handed me the items. The photo showed a tow-headed little boy with a face like the Gerber baby lying on a blanket. His clothes looked clean, as did his face and hands, and his eyes showed no sign of fear. I took these as a sign that his captor was not abusing him. Lying on the blanket was a copy of the <i>Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel </i>with the date prominently dis�played. It was a trick used by kidnappers to show that their victims were still alive. <br><br>I shifted my attention to the ransom note. Written in pencil, it said, <i>&#x201c;Stop talking to the FBI or Sampson will die.&#x201d; </i>The handwriting surprised me. Most kidnappers used typewriters, or glued letters cut from a magazine. Whoever had kidnapped Sampson obviously didn&#x2019;t think he was going to get caught. <br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking to the FBI about?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in their VICAP program,&#x201d; Abb said. &#x201c;I was supposed to go under hypnosis to help them identify those Jane Does. I still don&#x2019;t remember the things I did.&#x201d; <br><br>VICAP was the FBI&#x2019;s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. Cops had an expression when criminals entered programs like VICAP, and agreed to help the police. They called it taking a shot at heaven. <br><br>&#x201c;Does the FBI know you were contacted by your grandson&#x2019;s kid�napper?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>Abb shook his head. <br><br>&#x201c;How about the police?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>Abb shook his head again. <br><br>&#x201c;Why haven&#x2019;t you told them?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Because I want you to find him,&#x201d; Abb said. <br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met six guys in Starke who are serving life for kidnapping lit�tle kids. You put them here. That&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; <br><br>I slipped the ransom note into my pocket. <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to take the job?&#x201d; Abb asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; <br><br>I stood and so did Stone. She went over and placed her hand on Abb&#x2019;s shoulder. Under her breath she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you tomorrow, and let you know how the appeals are going.&#x201d; <br><br>Abb gazed up at her and nodded. <br><br>One of the guards slid back the cell door. Stone and I started to leave. I saw Abb look directly at me. Something resembling hope flickered in his eyes. I decided to level with him. <br><br>&#x201c;Your grandson&#x2019;s case is three days old,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a long time when it comes to a kidnapping. I need to do a lot of groundwork, and talk to a lot of people.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What are you trying to say?&#x201d; Abb asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I may not find Sampson before they execute you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Four days isn&#x2019;t enough?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t know until I start looking.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>I cut him off. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make promises.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the deal,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>Abb cast his eyes to the floor. He had asked me here because he did not want to go to his death knowing he&#x2019;d caused an innocent child to suffer. I had to think it was one of the more decent things he&#x2019;d done in his life. <br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he muttered. <br><br>He was still staring at the floor when we left.</p><h2>Knockout (FBI Thriller)</h2><p>Traveling with her mother to Georgia in the aftermath of her father&#39;s death, seven-year-old telepath Autumn Backman discovers her own family&#39;s murderous activities, desperately contacts FBI agent Dillon Savich, and promptly disappears, prompting a large-scale manhunt.

During their picnic lunch break, Baa notifies Boo that there is an ant on his sandwich. Unbeknownst to them (and noticed only by the most perceptive picture-perusers), their picnic spot is right next to a gigantic swarming anthill. They bolt, bravely pole-vaulting a creek. Much to their delight, they find not only some lovely blueberry bushes on the other side, but a nice, ant-free spot to finish their lunch. The beauty of this simple story is in the details. For starters, the cartoonish sheep could not be cuter. Their expressions when Baa spots the first ant and when Boo sits in wide-eyed, post-ant shock are priceless. When they ford the stream, a sideline frog hops out of danger. When "Boo and Baa spend a long time picking berries," Baa admires a flower, while Boo goes eye-to-eye with a snail on a stump.

However, the work of such artists did not spontaneously appear after World War II, nor was it simply transplanted from Europe. There is a longer, subtler history of the development of modernism in relation to American artists, as well as teachers, patrons and collectors, which can be traced through the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p>William C. Agee's analysis includes artists working in the first half of the century, such as Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O'Keeffe, and John Marin, as well as a discussion of the continuity between this period and the artists who went on to become celebrated internationally, such as Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Helen Frankenthaler, Willem de Kooning, Morris Louis, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Donald Judd.</p><p>Agee also integrates the work of certain European artists who became central to modern American art. Paul C�zanne, Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp and Piet Mondrian as well as Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann became influential teachers (and eventually American citizens), impacting strongly on the likes of Stuart Davis and many others, who have not necessarily been compared or connected to the European art canon previously.</p><p>As a radical re-evaluation of art history from the early twentieth century to the late 1960s, this brilliant new account of American modernism is a must-read for students and scholars of art as well as all those interested in modernism and its wider cultural history.</p></p><p>William C. Agee taught at Hunter College since 1988 until his retirement in 2014 and was awarded an endowed chair in 2004, the Evelyn Kranes Kossak Professor of Art History. Prior to Hunter, he held directorships at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and at the Pasadena Art Museum. Agee has published numerous articles and monographs in conjunction with exhibitions he has organized on artists such as Stuart Davis, Morgan Russell, Donald Judd and many others, as well as on aspects of modern art in America. His books include <em>American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942</em> (2011) and <em>Coming of Age: American Art, 1850s to 1950s</em> (2006).

Many of Britain&#39;s villages are known for their loveliness, of course, but their role in shaping the nation over the centuries is relatively untold, drowned out by the metropolitan bias of history. A consummate storyteller, Clive Aslet deftly weaves the worlds of agriculture, politics, the arts, industry, folklore, science, ecology, fashion and religion into one irresistible volume. The Bedfordshire works that a century ago manufactured half a billion bricks a year; the Cheshire municipality striving to become the country&#39;s first carbon-neutral community; the Derbyshire estate where the cottages represent the gamut of European architecture; the Gloucestershire community founded by Tolstoyans, who still live by anarchic principles; the Leicestershire town where pub walls are embedded with Jurassic-era fossils; the Morayshire settlement where Hogmanay is celebrated eleven days late; the Pembrokeshire fishing hamlet that inspired Dylan Thomas; the Somerset village that was built on the back of the trade in Peruvian bird droppings; the Suffolk village that is rejecting modernity by reconstructing a windmill for grinding flour; the Surrey woodland that fosters Europe&#39;s most ancient trees - all these are places that have made a unique contribution to the narrative of this country. Follow Clive Aslet in visiting all five hundred villages, and you will have experienced the history of these islands from a uniquely rural perspective.</p><p>Clive Aslet joined Country Life in 1977, and is now Editor at Large.

What was the purpose and meaning of this extraordinary project that the Nazis called &#34;The Final Solution?&#34; In this pathbreaking book, Richard Koenigsberg shows how genocide grew out of the logic of warfare. Hitler reasoned that if he had the right to sacrifice his soldiers, he also had the right to send Jews to their deaths. Hitler embraced his role as military leader, stating in the mid-thirties that if millions of Germans had to die in the next war, he would not shrink from this sacrifice. Based on a meticulous reading of Hitler&#39;s speeches and Mein Kampf, Koenigsberg shows how Hitler&#39;s thinking about warfare led to his decision to exterminate the Jews. Hitler reflected that if he had no compunctions about sending the &#34;best&#34; people to die in battle--German soldiers--why would he not also have the right to send the &#34;worst&#34; people--mortal enemies of Germany--to their deaths? Nations Have the Right</p><p>Despite the vast body of research devoted to the Holocaust, <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i> marks a seminal contribution to our understanding of this act of genocide. Prof. Koenigsberg reveals that as warped and twisted as Hitler's thinking was, his actions were firmly rooted within the ideology of nationalism. Hitler was a radical nationalist who believed that just as he had the right, even the duty, to sacrifice the cream of German youth in his struggle against the nation's external enemies, so too must he mercilessly destroy those he regarded as the nation's internal enemies, first and foremost the Jews. Thus, Koenigsberg claims, "The logic of genocide grew out of the logic of war." <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i> challenges the popular belief that Hitler was a uniquely inhuman monster. Hitler is placed squarely within the narrative of a much more widely held nationalist ideology that claims dying for one's country represents the apogee of love and devotion. The Holocaust thus becomes "a perverted, degraded version of dying for the country--a sacrificial death at the hands of the nation--state stripped of words like honor, heroism and glory." Given that both war and genocide remain all too pervasive in today's world, <i>Nations Have The Right To Kill</i> forces us to reexamine, and reflect, on the true causes of these phenomena. <p> --Brian A. Victoria, Professor of Japanese Studies, Antioch University, author of <i>Zen at War</i> </p><p> Using Hitler as a focal point, <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i> offers a riveting examination of the ideology of political violence, articulating the profound connection between the First World War and the Holocaust. Through careful analysis of Hitler's writings and speeches, Koenigsberg makes us aware of the ideology that was the source of both warfare and genocide. In his declaration of war on September 1, 1939, Hitler demanded--of himself, and of all Germans--not simply obedience, but absolute commitment. He required acts of sacrifice as a demonstration of loyalty. "In giving one's life for the existence of the community," Hitler declared, "lies the crown of all sacrifice." Everyone would have to be willing to sacrifice. No one would be exempt. Anyone who attempted to evade responsibility would be destroyed. Be ready to die for your country, or your country will kill you. Hitler understood Jews as a people unwilling to sacrifice; whose ultimate loyalty did not inhere in the nation. Thus did his perception of the Jews lead to genocide. The passionate obedience that became Hitler's demand was the pathology that led to war and genocide--both. Dr. Koenigsberg's is a message that anyone with an interest in changing the course of human history should internalize and reflect upon. Can human beings transcend war? If so, <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i> will be one of our most important guides. Its striking lucidity will be a catalyst for our collective evolution. </p><p> --Lee Hall, JD, author of <i>Capers in the Churchyard</i><br><br>In <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i>, Dr. Richard Koenigsberg challenges us to make new connections between the traumatic events of the First World War, their impact on Adolf Hitler, and the "Final Solution"--the Holocaust. Koenigsberg argues that Hitler in the First World War experienced firsthand the gruesome toll and awful reality of trench warfare. Instead of reacting to the horror he had witnessed and becoming a pacifist, Hitler took a different turn when he posed the question (in <i>Mein Kampf</i>): "Why during the First World War had some men died--sacrificed their lives--while others had not?" "Why did the best die in warfare while the worst survived?" Hitler believed that the willingness of a soldier to sacrifice himself in warfare--to be obedient unto death--was the supreme human virtue. He reflected that if he as leader of the German nation had the right to send "the best" into bloody battles, then he also had the right to sacrifice the lives of "inferiors" and "shirkers." </p><p> Koenigsberg challenges us to reflect upon Hitler's thought processes as the source of mass-murder. In mid-1942 when speaking about the murderous work of the <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> in the Soviet Union, Hitler declared: "If I don't mind sending the pick of the German people into the hell of war without the slightest regret over the spilling of precious German blood, then I naturally also have the right to eliminate millions of an inferior race that multiplies like vermin." If Hitler did not regret spilling precious German blood, why should he not also have the right to eliminate Jews--an inferior race? Hitler thus justified mass-murder according to the logic: If the nation-state can sacrifice its most valuable citizens--soldiers--it also should have the right to kill citizens that make no useful contribution to society--for example, incurable mental patients and Jews. </p><p> <i>Nations Have the Right to Kill</i> proposes that solving the riddle of the Holocaust necessitates deconstructing the ideology of warfare. Hitler understood that war represents the occasion when a political leader is permitted to send his own soldiers to die. If a nation's commander-in-chief can send his "superior" citizens to their deaths, why can he not also send its "inferior" citizens to their deaths? Koenigsberg's work adds to our understanding of the relationship between the First World War and the Holocaust; and provides an intriguing insight into the origins of the tragic Second World War. </p><p> --Beth A.

It is charred and brittle. It is obscene. There is nothing so ugly in all the world as what a fire leaves behind, covered in ashes and smoke and a smell you&#x2019;ll think about every day for the rest of your life."</i><br><br>Steve Hamilton is one of crime fiction&#x2019;s rising stars. His first novel, <i>A Cold Day in Paradise</i>, won the Edgar Award, and each successive novel has met with widespread critical acclaim. Now Hamilton raises the stakes dramatically in his most accomplished work to date.<br><br>Reluctant investigator Alex McKnight finds himself drawn by friendship into a long drive north. The brother of Alex&#x2019;s longtime Ojibwa friend Vinnie LeBlanc works as a hunting guide, serving the rich clients from downstate. It seems that Vinnie&#x2019;s brother and his most recent group of hunters have vanished in northern Ontario, and Vinnie is scared enough to ask Alex to help him find them.<br><br>Their arrival sets in motion a heart-pounding string of events that leaves Alex and his friend miles from civilization, stranded in the heart of the Canadian wilderness with no food, no weapons---and no way out. And there&#x2019;s someone out there who definitely does not want them to make it back alive.<br><br>At once elegant and enormously suspenseful, Steve Hamilton&#x2019;s <i>Blood Is the Sky</i> heralds his arrival as one of the premier crime writers working today.<br></p><p>One of the most promising secondary figures in Steve Hamilton's series about reluctant northern Michigan PI Alex McKnight has always been his teetotaling Ojibwa Indian pal, Vinnie LeBlanc. But Vinnie remained mostly to himself through the first four McKnight adventures. <i>Blood Is the Sky</i> finally lets him loose, and it's both a pleasure and painful to see what results.<p> Vinnie's younger, ex-con brother, Tom, has disappeared. In violation of his parole, Tom had guided a small contingent of moose hunters into the pacific forests of Ontario, but none of them had returned home on schedule. To assuage Vinnie's worries, McKnight agrees to drive with him into Canada and look for the men. No luck; the owners of a money-losing lakeside lodge where those sportsmen had stayed say they departed days ago. So where did they go? Who were the two other, unidentified guys who came looking for them in advance of McKnight and his friend? And why was the hunters' vehicle abandoned, with their wallets inside, near an Indian reservation? Looking for answers, the detective and Vinnie set off into the woods, where hungry bears are by no means the most dangerous creatures they'll have to face.</p><p> Despite its <i>Deliverance</i>-like moments, and an explosively violent conclusion that's not sufficiently foreshadowed, <i>Blood Is the Sky</i> is really a gracefully composed study of character, as focused on Vinnie's strengths and failings as Hamilton's previous novel, <i>North of Nowhere</i>, was on the backstory of another series regular, bar owner Jackie Connery. Yet McKnight shines here, too, his self-effacing humor keeping readers amused, when they aren't amazed--again--by the lengths to which this supposedly lonerish sleuth will go to help a friend in trouble. <i>--J.

Chapman warns that the Aquino government is seriously uninformed about the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the leftist movement in general, and has "the same inclination not to take the movement seriously" as was the case with the Marcos government. The U.S. government on the other hand fears a political victory by the CPP, if not a military one (after nearly 20 years in the field, the New People's Army remains essentially a raid-and-ambush outfit). Chapman, correspondent for the Washington Post, makes it ominously clear that the Philippine rebellion contains ingredients common to the successful Third World revolutions of the post-World War II era. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Walking with the Savior</h2><p>This beautiful book will challenge and inspire readers of all ages with meaningful quotes from best-selling author Max Lucado.

Eyeworks</h2><p>In 1982 Greg Gorman was just beginning his career as a photographer, creating campaigns and publicity shoots for such films as <i>Tootsie</i>, <i>The Big Chill</i> and <i>Scarface</i>, with stars from the worlds of film, television and music gracing his studio on a daily basis. It was also at this time that Jeff Gorman and Gary Johns created a campaign for the famous Los Angeles-based eyewear company, L.A. Eyeworks, for which they hired Gorman as house photographer. The ads were published as full-page bleeds in Andy Warhol's <i>Interview</i> magazine; and the campaign, one of the very first celebrity endorsed "advertorials" of its kind, has endured over 30 years, making it one of the longest running photo-campaigns ever. Gorman was able to recruit stars for the campaign from his film-studio work, and Warhol--who personally called the photographer and requested to do an L.A. Eyeworks shoot, which led to the series' most famous portrait--also gathered famous faces for the company. Alongside Warhol, the many celebrities photographed by Gorman in their L.A. Eyeworks frames include Boy George, Philip Glass, Meryl Streep, Jodie Foster, Iman, Lypsinka, Bryan Ferry, Grace Jones, Quentin Crisp, John Waters, Johnny Rotten, Rob Lowe, Whoopi Goldberg, Mickey Rourke, Frank Zappa, Elton John, Divine, Pierce Brosnan, David Hockney, Debbie Harry and Pee Wee Herman. Gorman's luscious, era-defining, black-and-white photographs are gathered here for the first time.</p><p>Greg Gorman Over the past 40 years, Greg Gorman has photographed famous and infamous faces for film, music, politics, sports, advertising and pleasure. Greg continues to seek out projects worldwide that both grant him new experiences and provoke his inspiration. Between spending time at his homes in Los Angeles and Mendocino, where he also teaches, Greg conducts workshops and lectures internationally, and hosts exhibitions of his fine art photography.

In this exciting and significant book, Andrew Thomas clearly illustrates the simplicity which lies behind nature at its fundamental level. It is revealed how all unifications in physics have been based on incredibly simple ideas. Using a logical approach, it is explained how the great 20th century theories of relativity and quantum mechanics share a common base, and how they can be linked using an idea so simple that anyone can understand it. An idea which is so simple it has been hidden in plain sight.</p><p>Andrew Thomas studied physics in the James Clerk Maxwell Building in Edinburgh University, and received his doctorate from Swansea University in 1992. He is the author of the What Is Reality? website (www.whatisreality.co.uk), one of the most popular websites dealing with questions of the fundamentals of physics.

Dor travels to the past via the magic tapestry of Castle Roogna and inhabits the body of an invading mundane barbarian. While in the past Dor is accompanied by a (not normally) giant spider named Jumper, who had been drawn into the tapestry with him, and meets his current governess Millie the ghost, a short time before her unfortunate demise. Dor must use his magic and every other resource he possesses to help beat back an invading wave of mundanes and find a way to restore Millie&#39;s zombie lover to life back in the present.Turns out the Zombie Master is Millies zombie lover and ends up providing the cure for his own curse.</p><p></p><h2>Promise Me You&#39;ll Shoot Yourself: The Downfall of Ordinary Germans, 1945</h2><p><p><b>The German bestseller on the final days of Nazi Germany</b></p><p>One of the last untold stories of the Third Reich is that of the extraordinary wave of suicides, carried out not just by much of the Nazi leadership, but by thousands of ordinary Germans, in the war's closing period. Some of these were provoked by straightforward terror in the face of advancing Soviet troops or by personal guilt, but many could not be explained in such relatively straightforward terms.</p><p> Florian Huber's remarkable book, a bestseller in Germany, confronts this terrible phenomenon. Other countries have suffered defeat, but not responded in the same way. What drove whole families, who in many cases had already withstood years of deprivation, aerial bombing and deaths in battle, to do this?</p><p> In a brilliantly written, thoughtful and original work, Huber sees the entire project of the Third Reich as a sequence of almost overwhelming emotions and scenes for many Germans. He describes some of the key events which shaped the period from the First World War to the end of the Second, showing how the sheer intensity, allure and ferocity of Hitler's regime swept along millions. Its sudden end was, for many of them, simply impossible to absorb.</p></p><p></p><h2>Albert Hadley: The Story of America&#39;s Preeminent Interior Designer</h2><p>Here, in his own words, is the first complete look at the career of Albert Hadley, legendary interior designer. A lavishly illustrated celebration of more than half a century of stunning interiors work, the book explores Hadley&#39;s personal and professional influences. It traces the path of a career that brought him into contact with all of the major figures in twentieth-century design: First as a student and then a professor at Parsons School of Design, where he became a close friend of Billy Baldwin and was by turn a student, friend, and colleague of Van Day Truex; to his working with Eleanor Brown at McMillen, Inc.; to his influential partnership, Parish Hadley, with the venerable Sister Parish; to his current work as the head of Albert Hadley, Inc. Exploring Hadley&#39;s design philosophy and process in great detail, the book covers the rooms that made design history, from the magnificent Rosedown Plantation to the Kennedy White House to Mrs. Vincent Astor&#39;s library. Enriched with dozens of new and archival images, as well as Hadley&#39;s acclaimed sketches and a catalogue raisonn� listing every major article and book written about Hadley&#39;s work, Albert Hadley is the definitive, exclusive look at one of the most brilliant designers this country has ever seen.</p><p>Adam Lewis is the author of Van Day Truex, a biography of the great style icon of the late twentieth century.</p><h2>The Diary of a Church Mouse</h2><p>The ninth in the Church Mice series, this book takes us through a year in Humphrey&#39;s diary in which Samson, the cat, Arthur and the other Church Mice all have their place. It is told with a wealth of comic detail for which this series is famous.</p><p>Grade 2-4 Resolving on New Year's to write the Story of His Life, Humphrey the schoolmouse decides instead to keep a diary. (His friend Arthur advises waiting on the autobiography until Humphrey is very old so he'll know what happens in the last chapter.) Against the backdrop of changing seasons and holidays, readers follow a year's adventures of the mice and their cat-friend, Sampson. This ninth title about the church mice sports the familiar full-page and numerous smaller illustrations, which both amplify and deliberately contradict the text (to enormous comic effect). The energy and busy activity of the illustrations, which are lavishly detailed, call for close and repeated examination; many tiny dramas are going on within the larger context of the story. The long text and sophisticated level of humor based on Humphrey's self-aggrandizement recommend this for sharing with older children. Susan H. Patron, Los Angeles Public Library<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gustavus Adolphus</h2><p>Gustavus Adolphus (1594&#x2013;1632), King of Sweden, has been rightfully hailed as the father of modern warfare and as the most outstanding commander of the Thirty Years' War (1618&#x2013;1648). Forming the first national conscript army in modern Europe, he emphasized officer education, strict discipline, rigorous training, and the combination of firepower and mobility, until he had forged a formidable fighting force that stands unrivaled between Caesar's legions and Napoleon's <i>Grande Arm�e.</i> In 1630 Gustavus rescued the beleaguered Protestant cause in Germany from the Catholic League of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II militarily, led by the era's two other great captains, Tilly and Wallenstein. Gustavus triumphed against them (twice defeating Tilly) in battles that are tactical masterpieces, but he was killed while leading a cavalry charge at Lutzen.Illustrated with nearly 250 drawings and maps, Dodge's brilliant work (1895) not only examines the life, battles, and military innovations of Gustavus Adolphus but continues beyond the end of the Thirty Years' War to 1712, discussing his influence upon the great captains who followed&#x2014;Turenne, Cond�, Eugene, and Marlborough. The result is a clear, comprehensive study of a neglected but crucial period in the annals of warfare.</p><p></p><h2>The Colorado Weather Book</h2><p>Written by Colorado meteorologist Nelson, this generously illustrated book provides an overview of the history of Colorado weather from pre-1900 to the present and describes seasonal highlights such as where and when to view Colorado's famous golden aspen.

Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p></p><h2>Lacan</h2><p><p>The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901&#x2013;1981) is a uniquely complex writer and the originator of an especially unsettling view of the human subject. But the singularity of Lacan&#x2019;s achievement has been understated by many of his critics. Often he is seen merely as a figure famous for being famous&#x2015;an essential reference point in structuralist and poststructuralist debate&#x2015;rather than as a theorist whose writings demand and reward detailed scrutiny.</p><p>Malcolm Bowie traces the development of Lacan&#x2019;s ideas over the fifty-year span of his writing and teaching career. The primary focus is on the fascinating mutations in Lacan&#x2019;s interpretation of Freud. Bowie reinserts the celebrated slogans&#x2015;&#x201c;The unconscious is the discourse of the Other,&#x201d; &#x201c;The unconscious is structured like a language,&#x201d; and so forth&#x2015;into the history of Lacan&#x2019;s thinking, and pinpoints the paradoxes and anomalies that mark his account of human sexuality. This book provides a firm basis for the critical evaluation of Lacan&#x2019;s ideas and the rhetoric in which they are embedded; it is based on a close reading of Lacan&#x2019;s original texts but presupposes no knowledge of French in the reader.</p><p>Although Bowie is sharply critical of Lacan on several major analytic questions, he argues that Lacan is the only psychoanalyst after Freud whose intellectual achievement is seriously comparable to Freud&#x2019;s own. <i>Lacan</i> provides the ideal starting point for any exploration of the work of this formidable thinker.</p></p><p>Malcolm Bowie is Master of Christ&#39;s College, Cambridge. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and the Royal Society of Literature, an Honorary Member of the Modern Language Association of America, and an Officier dans l&#39;Ordre des Palmes Academiques. His books include Mallarme and the Art of Being Difficult; Freud, Proust and Lacan: Theory as Fiction; Lacan; and Proust among the Stars, which was a Los Angeles Times Best Book of 1999 and won the 2001 Truman Capote Prize for Literary Criticism.&#x201c;This is an astonishing feat of exposition, clear, judicious and economical in argument, and written with an elegance one would not have believed possible on so intractable a subject. Having read Bowie, one can revisit Lacan buoyed up by the conviction that he is a psychoanalytical thinker absolutely worth tangling with, a genuine enlarger of the mind and not a fly-by-night showman. Lacan is here thoroughly elucidated without being made simple, the elucidator having invested his intellectual all in being equally fair to the tortuosities of his subject and the needs of his readers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Sturrock</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While there have been a number of good studies introducing readers to Lacan&#x2019;s vatic discourse, Bowie&#x2019;s book strikes me as quite the best general presentation and evaluation of Lacan&#x2019;s thought. Witty, concise, irreverent, admirably well-written, Bowie&#x2019;s study represents a remarkable feat of organization and exposition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Brooks</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Well-written, well-argued, cogent, enjoyable to read&#x2015;these are hardly the words that spring to mind when one thinks of a book about one of the most obscure and self-absorbed thinkers influencing literary and cultural analysis today; yet they describe this remarkably accessible and intelligent new study of the French psychoanalyst... Bowie cuts to the essential issues of Lacan&#x2019;s thought and intellectual development. For those put off by Lacan&#x2019;s pomposities and those engaged by his brilliance, Bowie&#x2019;s introduction is an indispensable new resource.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An introduction which simplifies nothing, an initiation which demystifies, and an invitation to the widest possible English-speaking readership to have a look, or another look, at Lacan.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katharine Swarbrick</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;I believe that this is the first true <i>introduction</i> to Lacan&#x2019;s work in English.

Sevely reconstructs evidence that seems to have been well known in ancient and traditional cultures but lost in modern patriarchal onesthat the male and female are strikingly similar in both sexual structure and sexual function. Drawing on results of a seven-year study she conducted at Harvard, as well as a variety of sources from different disciplines, she explains how her discovery of "Lowndes crowns" in both men and women revises our understanding of anatomy and suggests a new theory of orgasm.

Jimmy Bishop loves doing 3 things: 1) Laughing at funny dog videos online, 2) watching his favorite show (Stop! Police!) on TV, 3) and reading his favorite vampire book (Fang Goodness) over and over. His self-involved older sister and workaholic Mom think he needs to stop obsessing already! But when his Dad finally allows Jimmy to get a puppy before school starts, everything changes and Jimmy has something new to focus on: his amazing dog, Abby who seems to have some very unusual habits. She sleeps all day but is wired at night, and she runs from the garlic kelp biscuit made by Jimmy&#39;s strange new babysitter Mrs. Cragg. There&#39;s just something different about Abby. Could she possibly be...a vampire? Jimmy&#39;s best friend Irwin thinks Jimmy&#39;s being ridiculous, but then when Abby uncovers a real crime in progress and helps him become friends with an actual, human girl, even Irwin has to admit that perhaps Abby might have some super powers after all.</p><p></p><h2>Graduation (Final Friends, No. 3)</h2><p>The last day of school has arrived at Tabb High. Michael Olson is convinced that Alice&#39;s death, nine months before, was murder rather than suicide and is just concluding his investigations. Will he survive this day?.</p><p>Grade 7 Up-- Pedestrian prose, improbable situations, and unlikable characters abound in this final volume to the "Final Friends" series. A rather long introduction rehashes the events in the first two volumes in which Alice committed suicide and Maria was crippled when someone sabotoged a homecoming float. In The Graduation , Michael is determined to prove that Alice's death was not a suicide. An all-night cruise, devoid of adult supervision, enables Michael to confront all of the students who were at the party when Alice died. Polly, Alice's sister, had actually staged the suicide to hide Alice's accidental death. Polly is crazy and feels responsible for both her sister's death and the earlier deaths of their parents in a car accident. Her dealings with an imaginary nemesis may cause some comprehension problems for poorer readers. Despite a serious head wound and concussion, Michael manages to have sex with Jessica; Maria regains the ability to walk; and several couples run off to be married. --Susan H.

All he's got to do is pull off the ultimate makeover: turn Polly Paget-- a gum-chewing, foul-mouthed, big-haried broad-- into a perfect lady in time to testify in a rape case against Jack Landis, head of the Family Cable Network and America's most beloved family man. But Polly isn't cooperating, and everyone-- including a former FBI agent, and an obsessive-compulsive hitman, the Mafia, a porn prince, and a slew of tabloid reporters-- is on her trail turning Neal's "simple" assignment into a deadly game of duck-duck-goose.<br><br>In a hellish and hilarious escapade that takes him from the deserts of Nevada to the bright lights of Las Vegas, and finally to a hair-raising climax in a shoddily built amusment park, Neal tries to escape the mob's big guns while taking a slippery walk up the world's biggest water slide.<br></p><p>DON WINSLOW is the author of thirteen books and has also written for film and television. On his way to becoming a writer, he did a number of things to make a living -- private investigator, safari guide, actor, and theater director, among others. His first novel, <i>A Cool Breeze on the Underground</i> (Book 1 in the Neal Carey Mysteries), was nominated for an Edgar Award, and <i>California Fire and Life</i> received the Shamus Award. He now lives in Southern California.A change of pace for Neal Carey, who's been petulantly hunting down people for the Friends of the Family (Way Down on the High Lonely, 1993, etc.). This time, Joe Graham and the other Friends want him to keep much-hunted Polly Paget under wraps in the Nevada desert while he cleans up her grammar, her diction, and her act before she goes on network TV to denounce her boss, Jackson Landis, founder and majority owner of the Family Cable Network, as a rapist. The real change, though, is in the tone of this caper. Neal's intellectually elitist mysticism wouldn't cut it as Polly's pursued by (1) a former FBI agent working for Jackson Landis and Candy, his wife and partner in a new theme park to be called (of course) Candyland; (2) a porn prince eager to sign Polly to a centerfold contract; (3) an unsavory developer who whitewashes his silent partnership in Candyland by going to confession every day; and (4) a hit man whose obsessive professionalism can't hide the fact that he keeps missing the target. So Winslow wisely shuffles Neal offstage for long, foolishly amusing stretches while Candy tracks down Polly and bonds with her; the senior Friends, learning that the New Orleans mob is moving in on Jack's empire, tiptoe away from backing Polly; and all parties concerned scramble to come out on top in a final tarantella worthy of Donald E. Westlake. Not as distinctive as Neal's earlier adventures, but the broadest, loosest, funniest of them all. It's great to see Neal taking a break from his M.A. thesis on that stinker Smollett without getting all hung up for a change. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this remarkably rich and eminently readable historical account, acclaimed author Paul Strathern reconstructs a mission of conquest inspired by glory, executed in haste, and bound for disaster.<br><br>In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte, only twenty-eight, mounted the most audacious military campaign of his already spectacular career. With 335 ships, 40,000 soldiers, and a collection of scholars, artists, scientists, and inventors, he set sail for Egypt to establish an Eastern empire in emulation of Alexander the Great. Like everything Napoleon ever attempted, it was a plan marked by unquenchable ambition, heroic romanticism, and not a little madness. <br><br>Napoleon saw himself as a liberator, freeing the Egyptians from the oppression of their Mameluke overlords. But while Napoleon thought his army would be welcomed as heroes, he tragically misunderstood Muslim culture and grossly overestimated the &#x201c;gratitude&#x201d; he could expect from those he&#x2019;d come to save. Instead Napoleon and his men would face a grim war of attrition against an ad hoc army of Muslims led by the feared Murad Bey. Marching across seemingly endless deserts in the shadow of the pyramids, suffering extremes of heat and thirst, and pushed to the limits of human endurance, they would be plagued by mirages, suicides, and the constant threat of ambush. A crusade begun in honor and intended for glory would degenerate toward chaos and atrocity.<br><br>But Napoleon&#x2019;s grand failure in Egypt also yielded vast treasures of knowledge about a culture largely lost to the West, and through the recovery of artifacts like the Rosetta Stone, it prepared the way for the translation of hieroglyphics and modern Egyptology. And it tempered the complex leader who believed it his destiny to conquer the world. <br><br>A story of war, adventure, politics, and a clash of cultures, Paul Strathern&#x2019;s <b>Napoleon in Egypt</b> is history at once relevant and impossible to put down.</p><p>Paul Strathern studied philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin. He has lectured in philosophy and mathematics and is a Somerset Maugham Prize&#x2013;winning novelist. He is the bestselling author of several books of nonfiction, including the series <i>Philosophers in 90 Minutes</i> and <i>The Big Idea: Scientists Who Changed the World. </i><i>Chapter One<br>The Origins of the Egyptian Campaign</i><br><br>Since earliest times, Egypt had been a source of wonder to the European eye. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, visiting the country in the mid fifth century BC, encountered the following scene: "During the flooding of the Nile only the towns are visible, rising above the surface of the water like the scattered islands of the Aegean Sea. While the inundation continues, boats no longer keep to the channels and rivers, but sail across the fields and plains. On a journey far inland you can even sail past the pyramids." Less than two centuries later, the Macedonian Greek Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, completing this task in a matter of months, but remaining long enough to found the city of Alexandria, whose site he selected in 331 BC at what was then the western mouth of the Nile delta. After this, in what appeared to be a characteristic act of hubris, but was in fact an attempt to win over the local priesthood, Alexander sacrificed to the sacred bull Apis and had himself crowned pharaoh. He then set off east on his campaign of conquest against the Persians, during which he planted the seeds of Greek culture across a great swath of Asia. Eight years later, having extended his conquests to the limits of the known world, Alexander died after a drinking bout in Babylon, and his body was brought back to Alexandria to be buried in a magnificent tomb, made of gold and glass, whose site has since been lost.<br><br>In Roman times, Egypt would become the granary of the Mediterranean world, providing over a third of the grain supplies for the entire Roman Empire. During the first century BC Alexandria would become the focus of stirring events which changed the fate of that empire, when the charms of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, proved irresistible first to Julius Caesar and then to Mark Antony, while rivalry between these two ambitious men plunged the Roman Empire into civil war.<br><br>Under the Greeks, and then the Romans, Alexandria would become the intellectual capital of the Western world, the city that produced Euclid and educated Archimedes, its celebrated library a repository of all knowledge. It was here that Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth and its distance from the sun. For the latter, he used the known fact that on a certain day the sun could be seen at the foot of a deep well in Aswan 500 miles to the south, and was thus directly overhead. He then measured the length of the shadow cast by a pole in Alexandria, and thus the angle of the sun's rays there; using trigonometry, he then calculated the distance of the sun within around 5 percent of the accepted modern figure. Such was the reach and achievement of Alexandrian learning at its prime. When its library burned down in two disastrous fires, the last of which was started by zealot Christians in AD 391, the ancient world lost over half a million scrolls, and with these as much as a quarter of the knowledge and cultural heritage of Western civilization vanished forever.<br><br>French interest in Egypt began with the Seventh Crusade in the thirteenth century, led by Louis IX (who partly on account of this became known as St. Louis). In 1248 the king and over 30,000 men disembarked from 100 ships near Damietta on the Nile delta. Here they encountered the full might of the Mameluke cavalry, which inflicted on them a crushing defeat, capturing Louis and holding him to ransom.<br><br>The Mameluke cavalry was arguably the greatest war machine of the period, certainly superior to any European militia. In 1260, just ten years after the debacle of the Seventh Crusade, the Mameluke cavalry would encounter the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan's successor at the Battle of Ayn Jalut, just north of Jerusalem. Here they put the Mongol cavalry to flight, thus destroying for the first time the myth of their invincibility. Had the Mamelukes lost this battle, the Mongols could have pressed on across North Africa into Spain, encircling Europe. Not for nothing has this victory been reckoned as one of the great turning points of history, though it passed unnoticed in the medieval world it rescued. Meanwhile, to the European mind Egypt remained for the most part a land of Biblical legend: the setting of the plague of frogs, the Nile turning to blood, and Moses' parting of the Red Sea.<br><br>Four hundred years later, the German philosopher Leibniz would approach Louis XIV with a meticulously detailed plan for a French invasion of Egypt, including details of a Suez canal to facilitate trade with the Indies. Despite such lofty foresight, Leibniz's motive was in fact down to earth and devious: his employer, the Elector of Mainz, wished to divert the Sun King from invading the German states. But Louis rejected Leibniz's idea, informing him that "since the days of St. Louis, such expeditions have gone out of fashion." The papers detailing the scheme would gather dust in the archives at Hanover after Leibniz's death. It has been suggested that Napoleon might have been inspired by these plans, but it is now certain that he had no idea of their existence until he passed through Hanover in 1803, some years after his Egyptian expedition. When they were drawn to his attention, he remarked cryptically: "This work is very curious." Nonetheless, Leibniz's plans remain relevant; his scheme represented a trend that would flourish recurrently during the ensuing centuries: namely, the European habit of exporting internal conflicts to the territories of other continents.<br><br>Despite the rejection of Leibniz's scheme, during the ensuing century France expanded its colonial empire to Canada, Louisiana, the West Indies and India. Other European powers were engaged in similar enterprises, and this soon resulted in conflict, most notably between Britain and France. Britain's growing economic and maritime power eventually tipped the balance, with rapid and disastrous effect on the French colonies. In 1761 France lost Pondicherry and trading posts on the east coast of India; in 1762-3 it was forced to cede the Louisiana Territory to the Spanish and the British; and in 1763 it lost sovereignty over its Canadian colonies to Britain. France's valuable sugar-producing colonies in the West Indies&#x2014;Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Dominique (Haiti)&#x2014;now looked particularly vulnerable. Mindful of this state of affairs, Louis XV's foreign minister, the Duc de Choiseul, came up with a scheme to take over Egypt in 1769, the very year Napoleon was born. Given Egypt's climate and its plentiful cheap labor, it was ideal for sugar plantations, and could easily supplant if not exceed France's imports from the West Indies. The fact that Egypt was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, a long-term ally of France, could easily be overcome by the simple expedient of buying it from the Turks. The following year the aging Louis XV took the courtesan Madame du Barry as his mistress, de Choiseul fell from favor, and his planned introduction of retail theory into foreign policy was shelved.<br><br>Yet France's colonial situation remained under threat, and in 1776 the idea of turning Egypt into a French colony was resurrected, when the Ministry of the Navy decided to dispatch an envoy there. The man chosen was Baron Fran�ois de Tott, a Frenchman of Hungarian descent who had lived in the eastern Mediterranean for several years and had much experience of Levantine affairs. Yet this experience would prove of little avail. On his arrival in Cairo, de Tott was immediately escorted to the Citadel, the city's fortress, where he had an audience with the pasha "surrounded by all the pomp of his Vizirate." De Tott described how "the Pasha sent away the crowd which filled the hall of the Divan, [whereupon] he confided to me that there was a fermentation amongst the beys (a sure sign that a revolution was about to take place)." No sooner had de Tott arrived at the French consul's house than a revolt duly erupted and he found himself barricaded in for his own safety "while the ruling beys took possession of the Citadel, forcing the Pasha with a pistol under his throat to issue an order banishing the revolters into exile . . . but the rebels, despising such vain formalities, began firing at their enemies. . . . After several days of blasting their guns, with more noise than effect, the ruling beys fled from the Citadel into Upper Egypt . . . and a new group of beys declared themselves to be in charge." Such chaos had now become a regular feature of life in Egypt, with the pasha, who was nominally the Ottoman ruler, reduced to a mere figurehead at the mercy of the beys, the ruling provincial chieftains, all of whom were members of the warrior caste of Mamelukes.<br><br>The Mamelukes had a long history in Egypt. They were originally brought into the country around 1230 by the ruling Ayyubite sultan al-Malik, who purchased 12,000 youths from Turkey to strengthen his army. The word Mameluke derives from mamluk, the Arabic for "slave" or "bought man," though in this case the latter is closer to the actuality. In a remarkably short time the imported Mamelukes had molded themselves into the fearsome fighting force encountered by Louis IX and the Seventh Crusade in 1248. Ten years later they became the major power in the land, murdering al-Malik's successor and establishing their own dynasty. At this stage they appear to have been largely Turkic&#x2014;non-Arab and non-Muslim in origin, often barely understanding Arabic. Yet curiously it was under this new dynasty that Egypt became established as the center of Arabic culture in the Muslim world, with the great Al-Azhar mosque as a beacon of learning, its medical and mathematical knowledge far outshining anything in medieval Europe. This was mainly due to the influx of refugee scholars from such places as Baghdad and Damascus, fleeing in the face of the Mongol hordes. Had the Mamelukes not defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ayn Jalut in 1260, the Muslim world, much like medieval Europe, would not have survived.<br><br>Yet just twenty years lat...</p><h2>Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars: Prima Official Game Guide</h2><p><p>*Thorough walkthrough&nbsp;of hub areas and&nbsp;all&nbsp;22 story missions including Freeplay mode!<br>*Detailed area maps with minikit locations and strategy! <br><b>*</b>Learn how to acquire characters, ships, vehicles, and Red Power and Gold bricks!<br>*Quick-reference checklist tables for fast access to unlockables/collectibles in the game!<br>*Includes seperate&nbsp;walkthrough and strategy for the Nintendo DS version!</p></p><p></p><h2>Nothing Can Stop God from reaching us: A Dachau Diary by a Survivor (Carmel in the World)</h2><p>On July 25, 1940, while helping to prepare for the celebration of Mass, Brother Raphael was arrested by the Gestapo police of the Nazi regime.

An almost limitless archive of our history lies hidden inside our bodies and we carry the ancient story of Scotland around with us. The mushrooming of genetic studies, of DNA analysis, is rewriting our history in spectacular fashion. In <i>Scotland: A Genetic Journey</i>, Alistair Moffat explores the history that is printed on our genes, and in a remarkable new approach, uncovers the detail of where we are from, who we are and in so doing color vividly a DNA map of Scotland.</p><p><p><b>Alistair Moffat</b> was born and bred in the Scottish Borders.

He teaches traditional Karate in a very contemporary way. Even though he teaches traditional Karate, almost every one of his approaches to training are different than traditional methods. His intent is to make Karate easier to comprehend and learn. <p>Unfortunately many Karate instructors use a "Monkey see Monkey do" approach to teaching - Sugiyama doesn't. If a college is a place where one goes to learn how to think then the Sugiyama Dojo (school) is where one goes to teach oneself Karate through thought and reason. Sugiyama encourages questions and debate. His job as teacher is to help his students gain a better understanding of Karate and guide their learning so that they can improve. He believes that eventually every student should become better than the teacher. </p><p>Similarly, Sugiyama's books reflect his unique approach to Karate. 25 Shoto-Kan Kata was the first book to use three dimensional drawings. His other books also break new ground and continue to develop the art of Karate. He believes that just as the student should surpass the teacher his books will eventually become obsolete (or collector's items) as new books are written. This constant drive toward innovation and development marks Sugiyama as a one of a kind Karate instructor. </p><p>Shojiro Sugiyama was born in Tokyo in 1929. In 1954, after training in two other styles of Karate, he began studying with the Japan Karate Association (Yotsuya), Japan. In 1963, he was invited to come to Chicago to teach Karate. He continues to teach Karate at his dojo located on the north side of Chicago.</p></p><h2>The World According to Garp</h2><p>World According to Garp</p><p>"Garp was a natural storyteller," says the narrator of John Irving's incandescent novel, referring to the book's hero, the novelist Garp, who has much in common with Irving himself. "He could make things up one right after the other, and they seemed to fit."<p> Irving packs wild characters and weird events into his classic--officially recognized as such in a Modern Library edition with a new introduction by the author--while amazingly maintaining the rough feel of realism in every scene and the pulse of life in every heart. Many novelists of his time might have populated a novel with a novelist protagonist whose life and books comment on each other and the novel we're reading. Transsexual football players, ball turret gunners lobotomized in battle, multiple adultery, unicycling bears, mad feminists who amputate their tongues in sympathy with the celebrated victim of a horrifying rape--Irving made them all people. Even the bear is a fitting character. </p><p> In a crucial episode, Garp's wife's seduction of a young man coincidentally occurs at the moment when Garp is delighting their young sons with a reckless car trick (one of the few scenes beautifully, eerily, heartbreakingly captured in the film version as well). Many authors would have been content with the harsh comedy of the scene, but Irving respects its integrity, and he builds the rest of the book on the consequences of the event. How does he get away with his killer cocktail of slapstick and horror? Because it's simply what we all face daily, rearranged into soul-satisfying art. "Life is an X-rated soap opera," according to Garp, and who can contradict him?</p><p> Rereading <i>Garp</i> 20 years later, one is struck by how elegantly Irving structures his bizarre and complex story. Take the two most celebrated bits in the book, the Under Toad and Garp's story "<i>The Pension Grillparzer,</i>" which shimmers like an exquisite Kafkaesque insect in the amber of the novel. When Garp warns his son about the "undertow" at the beach, the boy imagines a monster out of <i>Beowulf</i> who lurks beneath the waves to suck you under: the "Under Toad." It's funny at first, but we soon find that the Under Toad is a metaphor with teeth--he connects with a prophetic dream of death in "The Pension Grillparzer," set in Vienna. Garp's son's last words are, "It's like a dream!" And as Irving--who studied at the University of Vienna--can certainly tell you, the German word for "death" sounds precisely like the English word "toad."</p><p> All that death, and yet Garp is mainly exuberant. This story is, as Garp's stuttering writing teacher puts it, "rich with lu-lu-lunacy and sorrow." It enriches literature, and our lives. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>To be honest, I never read John Irving before I read A Widow For One Year. But after I finished Widow, I went on a John Irving reading frenzy. I read A Prayer for Owen Meany, The 158 Pound Marriage, The Water-Method Man, and The Cider House Rules.<br><br>Then I fell in love with Garp.<br><br>When John Irving agreed to read the new introduction to The World According to Garp for our new Unabridged AudioBook, we were thrilled. He would record in New York, on a Wednesday morning, but needed a ride to the studio. Could anyone give him a lift?<br><br>Please.

Eugene Smith's epic study of Pittsburgh in the 1950s.</strong></p> In 1955, having just ended his high-profile but stormy career with <em>Life</em> magazine by resigning, W. Eugene Smith was commissioned to spend three weeks in Pittsburgh and produce one hundred photographs for noted journalist and author Stefan Lorant's book commemorating the city's bicentennial. Smith stayed a year, compiling nearly sixteen thousand photographs for what would be the most ambitious photographic essay of his life. But only a fragment of the work was ever seen, despite Smith's lifelong conviction that it was his greatest set of photographs. Now, in an astonishing, first-time assemblage, edited by Sam Stephenson, of the group of core pictures that Smith asserted were the "synthesis of the whole," we see a portrayal not just of Pittsburgh but also of America at mid-century by a master photojournalist. In his accompanying essay, Alan Trachtenberg provides a critical reading of Smith's photographs, assessing Smith's attempt to document visually an American city in the context of the time period. 175 duotone photographs</p><p><p><strong>Sam Stephenson</strong> is a writer and consultant at the Center for Documentary Studies.</p><p><strong>Alan Trachtenberg</strong> is Neil Grey Professor of American Studies and English Literature at Yale University.</p>In 1955, the historian Stefan Lorant hired W. Eugene Smith to make a hundred photographs of contemporary Pittsburgh for a book in celebration of the city's bicentennial; he expected the job to take no more than three weeks. But Smith, whose grand ambitions and uncompromising aesthetic had recently led him to resign his stormy tenure at Life, quickly became obsessed, shooting some seventeen thousand pictures. Inspired by Joyce and Faulkner, Smith envisioned a symphonic, multilayered photo essay portraying the entire city; his failure to complete it haunted him for the rest of his life. Here are more than a hundred and fifty of his noirish and oddly poignant images: gleaming railyards at night; buildings wrapped in clouds of industrial smoke; the face of a steelworker, the Bessemer fires reflected in his safety goggles. <br> Copyright � 2005 <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>The Martini: An Illustrated History of an American Classic</h2><p>A chilled, crystal glass; the purest gin; a touch of dry vermouth--vigorously shaken, not stirred--and a plump, green olive.

According to Professor Bruner, cognitive science has set its sights too narrowly on the logical, systematic aspects of mental life--those thought processes we use to solve puzzles, test hypotheses, and advance explanations. There is obviously another side to the mind--a side devoted to the irrepressibly human acts of imagination that allow us to make experience meaningful. This is the side of the mind that leads to good stories, gripping drama, primitive myths and rituals, and plausible historical accounts. Bruner calls it the "narrative mode," and his book makes important advances in the effort to unravel its nature. </p><p> Drawing on recent work in literary theory, linguistics, and symbolic anthropology, as well as cognitive and developmental psychology Professor Bruner examines the mental acts that enter into the imaginative creation of possible worlds, and he shows how the activity of imaginary world making undergirds human science, literature, and philosophy, as well as everyday thinking, and even our sense of self. </p><p> Over twenty years ago, Jerome Bruner first sketched his ideas about the mind's other side in his justly admired book <i>On Knowing: Essays for the Left Hand</i>. <i>Actual Minds, Possible Worlds</i> can be read as a sequel to this earlier work, but it is a sequel that goes well beyond its predecessor by providing rich examples of just how the mind's narrative mode can be successfully studied. The collective force of these examples points the way toward a more humane and subtle approach to the investigation of how the mind works. </p></p><p><b>Jerome Bruner</b> is University Professor at New York University and the author of many books, including <i>Acts of Meaning</i>; <i>On Knowing</i>; <i>The Process of Education</i>; and <i>Toward a Theory of Instruction</i> (all published by Harvard).A brilliant synthesis of contemporary anthropology, sociology, literary theory, and philosophy as well as psychology. (Michael Stern <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>This delightful volume invites the reader into dialogue with one of the most imaginative, articulate, and broadly sophisticated scholars of the present era. Bruner...draws on his wealth of knowledge in psychology, linguistics, literary theory, and other domains to weave a rich tapestry of interrelated themes. The essays treat such topics as narrative thought, transactional theory of child development, constructivism, education, and literary criticism. What will surely be the most controversial proposal of the volume is that the human mind is equipped with two modes of cognitive processing, the one paradigmatic (designed to develop propositions subject to empirical test) and the other narrative (designed to comprehend and develop stories). The essays themselves are finely honed narratives, engaging and personal. (K. J. Gergen <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>It is perhaps possible to describe Bruner as being an intellectual by inclination, a cognitive psychologist eminent in his trade and an ardent academic who has spent his life questing for problems to solve and questions to pose. <i>Actual Minds, Possible Worlds</i> reflects all these interests and approaches as he debates how we create reality, possible worlds from actual minds. It is a book that raises many important problems and pertinent questions...[and] these essays will provide the reader with a stimulating journey...Bruner, as well as being an eclectic intellectual, is an indefatigable psychologist with many facets to his lifetime involvement in exploring the mind...[He] has a prose style that is elegant, professional and delightful...For those interested in liberal approaches to the development of mind and the mind's creative capacity for constructing imaginative acts it provides a provocative and stimulating discussion. (Margaret Martlew <i>British Journal of Psychology</i>)<br><br>Remarkably ambitious...[Bruner] necessarily takes cognitive psychology into the realms of philosophy, narrative, and literary theory, and to the largest questions about knowledge and mind...Admirable and moving. (Nancy Mergler and Ronald Schleifer, <i>Modern Language Notes</i>)<br><br>The human mind is everywhere at work, in daily life, in myth, in art, in science, in politics, showing a diversity and depth that cannot be reproduced in laboratory experiments. In order to get a comprehensive picture, the rigorous but narrow experimental approach must be supplemented by the breadth of the humanistic disciplines. This is what Bruner argues and what he exemplifies in <i>Actual Minds, Possible Worlds</i>. (Dan Sperber <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Bruner has combined his own academic gregariousness with a drive to fit his work into the canon of current Western thought... The mysteries of structuralism, deconstruction and pragmatism are unraveled here in the light of Bruner's lifelong efforts to make sense of the way we make sense of things...He makes culture here like a master.

McPherson, Edwards Professor of American History, Princeton University; Author of Pulitzer Prize-winning Battle Cry of Freedom</p><p>With the power and assurance of a master storyteller and the scrupulous accuracy of a trained historian, Harry Turtledove has created an immense, meticulously detailed, and utterly plausible world in which history takes a most unexpected turn. In The Guns of the South, Turtledove takes one of the most dramatic, bloody, and tumultuous episodes in our life as a nation, the Civil War, and vividly imagines what might have been had the rebels prevailed. In the unusually cold winter of 1864, General Robert E. Lee finds himself and his Army of Northern Virginia huddled on the banks of the Rapidan, trying to fight a war despite meager rations and a terrible lack of equipment - indeed, some of his men do not even have shoes. But when Lee finds a way to arm his forces, the tide suddenly turns; the rebels win a decisive victory at the Battle of Wilderness. Lee presses his advantage, marching on Washington. But if Lincoln surrenders, and the Confederacy can negotiate independence from the Union, there remain many obstacles to peace. The disputed states of Kentucky and Missouri must be accommodated. And the matter of slavery itself will threaten the newly independent Confederate States with fresh factional strife. Indeed, with victory come difficult choices for Robert E. Lee. War has worn down his health. His invalid wife lives for the day the two of them can finally build a peaceful life together. His days of service should be drawing to a close. Yet set against Lee&#39;s personal desires is the prospect of watching his beloved land squander the freedom that he and his men fought so desperately to win. Not for his own ambition but because duty calls, Lee will find himself faced with the price oftriumph. Mixing masterfully drawn historical and fictional characters, Turtledove brings to life the turmoil of a people in crisis. Here are the details of what it was like to fight in a Confederate army transformed from ragged to victorious: letters written home on scraps of wallpaper, &#34;coffee&#34; brewed from chicory and burnt grain, the fiery Battle of Wilderness, the march into Washington City and the confrontation with Lincoln, the negotiations between the United States and the Confederate States of America. Turtledove also takes us into conversations between General Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis and fascinating exchanges between Lee and Grant in their roles as keepers of the peace in a land divided. A highly original and extraordinary vision of history as it both was and could have been, The Guns of the South will take its place alongside the most exciting historical fiction ever written about the War Between the States.Harry Turtledove is an award-winning and bestselling author of science fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction. His alternate-history works include How Few Remain (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel), The Man with the Iron Heart, the Worldwar saga, the Colonization books, and the Settling Accounts series.</p><h2>Passing on: A Novel</h2><p>Still dominated by the memories of her late mother, Helen looks back on their lives together, and wonders why only her younger sister, Louise, found the courage to leave and live an independent life</p><p>Booker Prize-winning author Penelope Lively is that rare writer who goes from strength to strength in book after perfectly assured book.

On 9 June a two-pronged British attempt to surround and capture the city was defeated, but on the British forces' right flank, neighbouring American units had forced open a wide gap in the German front line. Seizing the opportunity to bypass Caen's defences, a mixed mobile force of tanks, infantry and artillery formed around the 7th Armoured Division's 22nd Armoured Brigade, advanced through the gap in a flanking manoeuvre towards Villers-Bocage. Under the command of Brigadier William "Loony" Hinde, the 22nd Armoured Brigade group reached Villers-Bocage without serious incident, but as its lead elements moved beyond the town on the morning of 13 June they were ambushed by Tiger I tanks of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. In less than 15 minutes numerous tanks and AFVs fell victim to the German force, the vast majority being destroyed by SS-Obersturmf�hrer Michael Wittmann's tank. The Germans then launched an assault on the town. Although this was repelled, after six hours, Brigadier Hinde decided to withdraw his force to a more defensible position outside the town. The British successfully defended their position until a controversial decision was taken to pull the Brigade group back from its salient.<br><i>I SS Panzer Corps at Villers-Bocage</i> has an eight-page gatefold depicting a Kampfgruppe (battle group) in battle deployment, with reconnaissance units, advance companies and the main body, to provide a visual guide to exactly how many tanks and other armoured vehicles were advancing on 13th June. The book itself provides background on the campaign and the units involved, a detailed breakdown of the battalion, its structure and equipment, its battle service at Villers-Bocage, and its service in the war after that point. Maps will be used to show the location of each element on the battlefield. The description of each part includes action reports, organization, equipment, unit commanders and much more. With a novel and accessible approach, the book will appeal to both the enthusiast and the general reader interested in World War II.</p><p>Since leaving the British Ministry of Defence in 2006 after 29 years&#x2019; service, David Porter has worked on a number of research projects, contributing articles and book reviews to the <i>BBC History Magazine</i>, the <i>British Army Review</i> and the <i>Royal Engineers Journal</i>.</p><h2>Mohawk-Reissue</h2><p><p>Mohawk, New York, is one of those small towns that lie almost entirely on the wrong side of the tracks. Its citizens, too, have fallen on hard times. Dallas Younger, a star athlete in high school, now drifts from tavern to poker game, losing money, and, inevitably, another set of false teeth. His ex-wife, Anne, is stuck in a losing battle with her mother over the care of her sick father. And their son, Randall, is deliberately neglecting his school work--because in a place like Mohawk it doesn't pay to be too smart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <b>Mohawk</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Richard Russo, explores these lives with profound compassion and flint-hard wit. Out of derailed ambitions and old loves, secret hatreds and communal myths, he has created a richly plotted, densely populated, and wonderfully written novel that captures every nuance of America's backyard.</p></p><p>The town of Mohawk may be provincial but it&#39;s far from sleepy. Its inhabitants seem perpetually awake, and not only on Saturday at two in the morning, &#34;when the bars are closing and people are forced to consider the prospect of returning home with so many of the night&#39;s dreams unfulfilled.&#34; Richard Russo focuses on several characters who are leading lives of extreme--and extremely funny--longing. Dallas Younger, for instance, hit his peak playing high-school football, and it&#39;s been downhill from there. He has no idea what women, particularly his ex-wife, are thinking, which makes him really glad there are none in on the local poker game. And he&#39;s still at a loss to figure out why he has no relationship with his son (probably something to do with the fact that he never sees him). Even the calendar at the local grill is for 1966, since the owner figures &#34;the months are the same&#34; and being a few days out of whack doesn&#39;t matter. This same man has a private betting system. Choosing among the top jockeys isn&#39;t that hard--he tries to assess their current levels of pride, concentration, and desire. Richard Russo shows us that these same qualities exist in his hard-luck characters.Originally published in 1986 in the Vintage Contemporaries paperback series--and reissued now in hardcover alongside his masterful new novel, "Empire Falls--Richard Russo's "Mohawk remains today as it was described then: A first novel with all the assurance of a mature writer at the peak of form and ambition, "Mohawk is set in upstate New York and chronicles over a dozen lives in a leather town, long after the tanneries have started closing down. Ranging over three generations--and clustered mainly in two clans, the Grouses and the Gaffneys--these remarkably various lives share only the common human dilemmas and the awesome physical and emotional presence of Mohawk itself. <br>For this is a town like Winesburg, Ohio or "Our Town, in our time, that encompasses a plethora of characters, events and mysteries. At once honestly tragic and sharply, genuinely funny, Mohawk captures life, then affirms it. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Callanetics Fit Forever</h2><p>The author of Callanetics presents a program that is specifically tailored to the needs of women over forty, offering clear, easy-to-follow instructions with accompanying photographs as well as additional guidelines for special conditions.</p><p>Callan Pinckney was the author of the bestselling Callanetics exercise programme and helped thousands of people lose weight, tone muscle and lead a healthier lifestyle.Callan, deviser of the nonimpact exercise program named after her, here addresses women older than 40.

He suggests that childhood is a relatively recent invention, which came into being as the new medium of print imposed division between children and adults.

To map a place is to control it, and Britain had its eyes on America's Pacific coast. And map it Vancouver did. His voyage was one of history&#x2019;s greatest feats of maritime daring, discovery, and diplomacy, and his marine survey of Hawaii and the Pacific coast was at its time the most comprehensive ever undertaken. But just two years after returning to Britain, the 40-year-old Vancouver, hounded by critics, shamed by public humiliation at the fists of an aristocratic sailor he had flogged, and blacklisted because of a perceived failure to follow the Admiralty&#x2019;s directives, died in poverty, nearly forgotten. In this riveting and perceptive biography, historian Stephen Bown delves into the events that destroyed Vancouver&#x2019;s reputation and restores his position as one of the greatest explorers of the Age of Discovery.</p><p><p><strong>Stephen R. Bown</strong> is the author of many critically acclaimed, award-winning titles, including most recently <em>White Eskimo</em> (Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2015), which was the winner of the 2016 William Mills Prize for Non-Fiction Polar Books. Bown lives in the Canadian Rockies.</p>Though mostly forgotten, the 1791-95 voyage of Capt. George Vancouver and his crew rivaled Columbus and Cook's for long-term impact; Vancouver's painstaking navigation through the uncharted Pacific set the path for modern North Pacific history. Bown (Scurvy, A Most Damnable Invention) provides a thorough, engaging account of a journey remarkable for its time and even more so in retrospect. Essential background information is flawed by excessive foreshadowing, but Bown's vivid account of Vancouver's work-mapping the labyrinthine coast between Northern California and southern Alaska, stopping off in Hawaii and Spanish California-proves fascinating. Plans for the voyage changed repeatedly; the end of the American Revolution, Britain's long rivalry with Spain, the pressure for new trade routes, manipulation by British politicians and fur traders, and the obsession with finding a Northwest Passage made a difficult, vague assignment nearly impossible. The last chapters read like a thriller, as Vancouver's health declines, his relations with the crew sour, and Britain and France go to war. Any fan of the Great Age of Sail, the history of the Royal Navy, or European voyages of exploration will enjoy rediscovering this almost-forgotten hero. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the past, community leaders and law enforcement officials have approached the problem, not as something that needs to be understood, but only as something to be gotten rid of. Rejecting that approach, James D. Vigil asserts that only by understanding the complex factors that give birth and persistence to gangs can gang violence be ended.</p><p>Drawing on many years of experience in the barrios as a youth worker, high school teacher, and researcher, Vigil identifies the elements from which gangs spring: isolation from the dominant culture, poverty, family stress and crowded households, peer pressure, and the adolescent struggle for self-identity. Using interviews with actual gang members, he reveals how the gang often functions as parent, school, and law enforcement in the absence of other role models in the gang members' lives. And he accounts for the longevity of gangs, sometimes over decades, by showing how they offer barrio youth a sense of identity and belonging nowhere else available.</p></p><p>Dr. Vigil introduces us to the history of Chicano gangs in Los Angeles, pointing out that many of these gangs have existed in the same neighborhood for three generations.James Diego Vigil is Professor of Social Ecology at the University of California, Irvine.</p><h2>Wild Shores (A First Responders Novel, 4)</h2><p>Gillian Gem&#x201d; Martin is the lead biologist at a wildlife sanctuary on the Northeast coast and head of the Wildlife Emergency Response Team called in when catastrophes, man-made or natural, threaten the endangered species she studies.

Carey Thomas (1857-1935) was an extraordinary woman whose career spanned the Victorian and modern worlds.<br><br>Her story is superbly told in a biography that resonates with the complicated interplay between he necessarily hidden private life and her eminently visible and successful public life as president of Bryn Mawr College, as a founder of the Johns Hopkins medical school and the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, as a leader in the women's suffrage movement, and as the preeminent spokeswoman for education around the turn of the century. Behind close doors, however, Carey Thomas was by no means the "proper Quaker daughter" many of her contemporaries assumed her to be. She was a freethinker. She was an ardent admirer of Swinburne, Rossetti, an the Pre-Raphaelites. She was a passionate woman whose lovers were women.<br><br>In rich detail and with insight and balance, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz recounts a life lived outside the bounds of nineteenth-century convention.

Carey Thomas (18571935). Horowitz (History &amp; American Studies/Smith; Campus Life, 1987, etc.) presents Thomas as a ``bundle of conflicting aspirations,'' a woman torn between scholarship, women's education, and art. Born in Baltimore in 1857 to Quaker parents, Thomas showed, early in life, an ambition to break through the social constraints placed on women. She studied abroad, was the first woman to earn summa cum laude honors for her Ph.D. from the university at Zurich, and then set her sights on the presidency of the newly founded Bryn Mawr College for women. After settling for the position of dean of Bryn Mawr at the age of 27, Thomas concentrated on education, sadly putting aside her own research and art, a compromise that continued after her ascendancy to the presidency ten years later. Although Horowitz practically apologizes for Thomas's turn to political conservatism and bureaucratic manipulations later in life, the educator shone as she struggled to succeed in a world not usually friendly to women. Horowitz follows her passionate affairs with women, primarily with long-time friend Mamie Gwinn and heiress Mary Garrett. When her 25-year relationship with Gwinn ended, Thomas experienced desperate pain, even though the affluent Garrett was waiting in the wings. Thomas's anti-Semitism and racism, certainly not a pretty part of the picture, are eclipsed in this account by her intense ambition and obsession with monetary gain. At 65, quite wealthy since Garrett willed the bulk of her estate to her, and after serving for 28 years as president of Bryn Mawr, Thomas retired to once again pursue her love of art and travel. At times burdened by its unrelenting attention to detail, Horowitz's account personalizes a courageous woman and provides the historical context to balance her complex and contradictory life choices.

For that reason Martyn Lloyd-Jones gave a series of lectures at Westminster Chapel to help ordinary people understand and apply theology to their own lives. This book is the fruit of those lectures.</p> <p>Previously published in three separate volumes, they are now combined into one work-a complete systematic Christian theology. Among others, the book covers Christian beliefs about Scripture, the attributes of God, the life and work of Jesus, the Fall, redemption, the person and work of the Holy Spirit, the nature of the church, and last things. The book is written in clear language and contains guidance for application. Anyone who wishes to learn more about the great doctrines of the Bible but doesn't want to wade through lengthy academic works should read this book.</p> <p><b>God the Father, God the Son</b></p> <p>This volume focuses on the very character of God and the life and work of his Son, including his eternal decrees, his attributes, original sin, redemption, the covenant of grace, and the Incarnation. <em>God the Father, God the Son</em> will help you to truly know God and his Word better. And in that pursuit, you can never go wrong. Because someday, somewhere, you will need to know&#x2013;and share&#x2013;the Truth with someone else.</p> <p><b>God the Holy Spirit</b></p> <p>This volume explores in detail the person and vital work of the Holy Spirit. He is a divine and mighty power who is active in conversion, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, and the assurance of salvation. Martyn Lloyd-Jones also considers within these pages Pentecost, baptism of the Spirit, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit&#x2013;all to give you a better understanding of this least-known member of the Trinity.</p> <p><b>The Church and the Last Things</b></p> <p>This volume explores in detail two doctrines that bear great impact on your today and all your tomorrows: the nature of the church, and the doctrine of the last things. Here is perspective on the Bible's various references to the church, plus a study of unity, baptism , church government, and the sacraments&#x2013;all according to Scripture. Martyn Lloyd-Jones also carefully considers the various views regarding Christ's second coming, what God's Word communicates about the last days, and the meaning of Jesus' return for ourselves as well as the world. It's important reading, not just for admirers of this great preacher, but for Christians everywhere.</p></p><p><p><strong>Martyn Lloyd-Jones</strong> (1899-1981), minister of Westminster Chapel in London for 30 years, was one of the foremost preachers of his day.

He lives with his family in Northern New Jersey.An original member of the DEA's legendary Group 93, which was founded in 1990 to target the drug cartels based in Cali, Colombia, Speziale has an amazing life story to tell, and in a breathless narrative, he (with freelance writer Seal) nails the high points of his 20-year-long career. From his troubled youth in New Jersey through his incarnation as the suave "Geraldo Bartone" to infiltrate the Cali gangs, to a final bout with career burnout, Speziale provides a detailed insider look at the tough life of undercover cops and the relentless pressure of a job in which the "only way to bust the cartel is to become part of it." As Speziale is schooled in the ways of a drug lord by a confidential informant-who later tries to double-cross him-the authors show just how easy and dangerous it is to go to Guatemala, build an airstrip, set up a business and begin to do large drug deals for the Cali cartel. Unfortunately, the book is written in a faux tough-guy style, reminiscent of old Miami Vice episodes. Speziale has lived an interesting life, but phrases like "I felt that roller-coaster ride ratcheting up another level" don't raise his tale beyond that of a B-movie. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Llama in the Family</h2><p>Believing that the surprise waiting for him will be the mountain bike he has been wanting, Adam is shocked when he arrives home to discover a llama in the backyard and tries to figure out how it will change his life. Reprint.</p><p>Johanna Hurwitz is the author of over five dozen books for young readers. She is the recipient of many state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, and the Garden State Children's Choice Award. She lives in Great Neck, NY, and Wilmington, VT.<p>Johanna Hurwitz always knew she wanted to be a writer. She started by telling stories to her brother, who is six years her junior, and she's been making up stories ever since. Born and raised in New York City, she earned her B.A. degree from Queens College and went on to receive a master's in library science from Columbia University. She embarked on a career as a children's librarian, but she never forgot that one day she wanted to write books, too.</p><p>She worked at the New York Public Library and in a variety of other public and school library positions. She also taught graduate courses in children's literature and storytelling at Queens College. When she and her husband, Uri--a college teacher and writer-and their children, Nomi and Beni, moved to Long Island, she continued her library work.</p><p>Although she had told original stories to her children, it was not until they were well along in school that Mrs. Hurwitz actually began to write down her stories. That's why, when children ask her how long it takes to write a book, she replies that her first, <i>Busybody Nora</i>, took her whole life.</p><p>But since then she has been writing with regularity, portraying with humor and sympathy the everyday incidents that are so important to children. She is particularly fond of seven- to nine-year-olds, because they are " so very open and get excited about small things," and she enjoys writing realistic fiction for and about them.</p><p>That these youngsters are equally fond of Mrs. Hurwitz's books is obvious. She has received many child-chosen state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Wyoming Indian Paintbrush Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, the Garden State Children's Choice Award, the West Virginia Children's Book Award, and others.</p><p>In recent years, Johanna Hurwitz has crisscrossed the United States from Juneau, Alaska, to Jackson, Mississippi, and from San Diego, California, to St. Albans, Vermont. She has even spoken abroad, from Morocco to Mozambique and from Portugal to Nicaragua. On these trips she has met and spoken to schoolchildren, teachers, librarians, and parents. She has made many new friends and has often brought home new ideas for her next book.</p><p></p>Grade 3-4-Another winning story from Hurwitz. Adam Fine is excited when his parents hint that there will be a surprise waiting for him when he gets home from school. He decides it must be the new mountain bike he has been wanting, so he is amazed (and a little disappointed) to find that it's a llama. As Adam and his four-year-old sister get to know the strange creature (dubbed Ethan Allen by their mother), it becomes an important part of the family. Adam, however, still wants a new bike and spends most of his time figuring out how to get one. However, when he finds a valuable braided rug in the attic that he could sell, he trades it in order to get another llama to keep Ethan Allen company and to help his mother's growing business, "Fine Llama Treks" for tourists. Hurwitz has created a believable, likable protagonist. While Adam sees himself as a talented wheeler-dealer and is a typical 10-year-old in many respects, he's also wise and considerate. Satisfying in its depiction of a happy, secure Vermont family, this enjoyable tale would fit nicely into any library.<br><i> Jan Shepherd Ross, Dixie Elementary Magnet School, Lexington, KY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lazybones (Tom Thorne Series, 3)</h2><p><p>The first corpse was found hooded, bound, and naked, kneeling ona bare mattress in a seedy hotel room. This was no ordinary murder but rather the work of a killer driven by something special, somethingspectacular. The fact that the dead man was a convicted rapist recently released from prison only increases the bizarre nature of the gruesome crime ... and the police's reluctance to apprehend the perpetrator. It's the body count that troubles Detective Inspector Tom Thorne, as brutal slaying follows brutal slaying, each victim more deserving than the last. Though he has no sympathy for the dead, Thorne knows he must put an end to a cruelly calculating vigilante's bloody justice before time runs out -- and a horrifically efficient serial killer targets a life worth fighting for.</p></p><p><p>Mark Billingham is the author of nine novels, including <em>Sleepyhead</em>, <em>Scaredy Cat</em>, <em>Lazybones</em>, <em>The Burning Girl</em>, <em>Lifeless</em>, and <em>Buried</em>&#x2014;all <em>Times</em> (London) bestsellers&#x2014;as well as the stand-alone thriller <em>In the Dark</em>. For the creation of the Tom Thorne character, Billingham received the 2003 Sherlock Award for Best Detective created by a British writer, and he has twice won the Theakston&#x2019;s Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Award. He has previously worked as an actor and stand-up comedian on British television and still writes regularly for the BBC. He lives in London with his wife and two children.</p>Fans of public television's various BBC <i>Mystery</i> programs would do well to tune into this third in Billingham's series (<i>Scaredy Cat</i>; <i>Sleepyhead</i>) featuring Detective Inspector Tom Thorne and his fellow officers of the London Metropolitan Police Service. After the body of a strangled and sexually violated male is found in a seedy hotel room, Thorne quickly learns that the victim was a convicted rapist. When a second recently released rapist is discovered in the same condition, Thorne believes he has a serial revenge killer on his hands. While some of his fellow policemen feel that the victims deserved their fate, Thorne's commitment to justice remains unfailing. Another murder follows, this time of a pornographer whom the detectives link to the other dead men. Billingham does not delve as deeply into either Thorne's personal issues or those of the other policemen as he did in his last book; the detective's dark brooding on the nature of death is replaced here by a healthier, less obsessive introspection. It's a wise move, making Thorne a more accessible character. He still has problems with women and commitment, and his father is still struggling with Alzheimer's, but Thorne has lightened up enough to get himself a girlfriend (though that doesn't work out quite the way he thought it would, to put it mildly). The structure is much like that of the other books, with the anonymous killer alternating chapters with Thorne and his partners until all of them come together in a shocking climax. This is a mature, intelligent novel by a writer who's as thoughtful as his main character, and the series grows better with each new addition. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just as a plane's gyroscope creates an artificial horizon line for the pilot, Denari often eliminates the physical earth as datum or locus of experience, turning to cultural, economic, and graphic forces as points of departure for his work. <br>Denari, the third director of Los Angeles's innovative Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), has made a reputation worldwide for his projects, installations, and writings on the question of technology and contemporary culture; it has been said of Denari's firm that it moves toward the question of place "with the same dynamic flow as a Boeing crossing the International Dateline headed for the arrival lounge at Narita Airport." <br>This long-awaited book combines photography, cultural criticism, and meditations on Los Angeles and Japan, along with Denaris trademark computer renderings and descriptions of over 20 architectural projects from the last ten years. Three of the most important projects discussed are the addition and renovation of the Arlington Museum of Art, the construction of an experimental space at Gallery MA in Tokyo (which won awards from I.D. Magazine and the Architectural Foundation of Los Angeles), and the first Microsoft retail store. Other projects include prototype housing in Tokyo, the Kansai-kan Library Competition, the Vertical Smoothouse in Los Angeles, Technology Research Park in Agoura Hills, and the Museum of the 20th Century in Los Angeles. <br><i>Gyroscopic Horizons</i>, whose territory ranges from the freeway to the Internet, illustrates the intense vision of this architect who draws inspiration from the complexities of modern-day machines and life.</p><p>Neil M.

Founded in the mid-1960s, the Black Mask group melded the ideas and inspiration of Dada with the anarchism of the Spanish Revolution, and this volume demonstrates how they heavily influenced the art, politics, and culture of the decade as they briefly shut down the Museum of Modern Art, protested Wall Street, battled at Students for a Democratic Society conferences, and defended the shooting of Andy Warhol. This history then details how in 1968 Black Mask reorganized as Up Against the Wall, Motherfucker, which combined the confrontational theater and tactics of Black Mask with a much more aggressive approach in dealing with the police and authorities.

Although the story takes place against the backdrop of war, it is not political, but a simple story about one day in the life of a young girl. After waking before dawn, Habiba and her sister go out to fetch water. Following a breakfast of khojur, she tags along with her brother and father as they bring the sheep to pasture. She goes to school outside with other girls; the boys attend school later in the day. Her family is preparing for cousins and an aunt and uncle to move in with them and Habiba wonders how everyone will fit into their small home.

Like her ceramic tile murals, her illustrations are colorful and detailed with strong forms and line work.</p>K-Gr 2 -- This simple story follows a young Afghani girl from sunrise to sunset. Living in Bamiyan, a relatively safe city, Habiba fetches water, attends school, and anticipates the arrival of her cousins, who have lost their home because of the war. The story captures the flavor of the culture, and the love and support of this close family is evident. The story is written in both English and Dari (Afghan Farsi), and an author's note provides supplemental information. Inglese's watercolor and collage illustrations are well composed, and color and pattern add richness and texture.

How many know why St. Elmo is portrayed in art with his intestines hanging out, or why St. Maximus is often shown commanding a bear to carry his luggage? <p>Probably none. The Catholic Church is all too eager to tell us about the Ten Commandments, the Resurrection, and the glories of St. Peter's Basilica, but how often do you hear about items like "Pope on a Rope" soap, or the "Let Us Spray" lawn sprinkler (shaped like Pope John Paul II, the sprinkler squirts water out of his outstretched arms as it spins)? </p><p>It's all here in "Pope-Pourri"-- an unprecendented collection of entertaining anecdotes, trivia, and intriguing information that the Catholic Church never told you about-- and in many cases doesn't want you to know about. Such as the bizarre story of the "Cadaver Synod", when Pope Stephen VI dug up the rotting corpse of his predecessor, Pope Formosus I, dressed it in papal robes, and put it on trial for "aspiring to the papacy" and other crimes. Other unusual footnotes to Catholic history include the Cataphrygians, an early separatist movement whose members prayed with their index and middle fingers inserted into their noses. </p><p>"Pope-Pourri" celebrates the wealth of amusing trivia the Church has produced during its 2,000-year history-- from oddball saints to the Vatican's censorious movie reviews, from strange Virgin Mary sightings to embarrasing secret scandals-- presented for the first time in one fascinating volume that practicing Catholics, lapsed Catholics, and the merely curious will all enjoy.</p></p><p></p><h2>Crusader Castles of the Teutonic Knights, Vol. 2: The Stone Castles of Latvia and Estonia, 1185-1560 (Fortress 19)</h2><p>The original forced conversion of pagan Livonia, what is now the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, was carried out by a military order known as the Brethren of the Sword. In 1236 this order was incorporated into the Teutonic Knights following a catastrophic military defeat. The knights had always consolidated their conquests through networks of castles and fortified places, and the Livonian Chapter of the Teutonic Order built castles of stone. This title covers the developmental and operational history of these fortresses over the length of the Middle Ages. It details how the Baltic fortifications of the Teutonic Knights evolved to reflect the changing nature of siege warfare and the increasing dominance of gunpowder in warfare.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull has published several books on the subject of warfare in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, and has developed a strong interest in Eastern European armies such as the Hussites and Muscovy. His books are always based on extensive scholarly research coupled with in depth study tours of the countries he is describing.&#x201c;David Nicolle's Teutonic Knight 1190-1561 offers unusual in-depth detail on one of the most famous Crusading Orders in history, which undertook campaigns in the Baltic against pagan Prussians and Christian Poles. Details include not only extensive historic notes but plenty of detail on military and religious sentiments and organizations of the times.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The California Bookwatch (January 2008)</i></p><h2>Babe Ruth&#39;s Own Book of Baseball</h2><p>Babe Ruth remains the most popular player in the history of baseball. The slugger for the New York Yankees established a home run record in the 1927 season, just a year before joining the league of authors. <i>Babe Ruth's Own Book</i> is a who's who&nbsp;of old-time greats&#x2014;Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and many others. It describes the Babe's rise from poverty to stardom, catching his image and voice as freshly and permanently as pen and ink can. In a no-nonsense style, the Babe describes the ins and outs of the game, touching all bases and loading up the reader with priceless information and advice. The surprise is that so little about the sport has changed except the size of the players' salaries.</p><p>How much of this anecdotally rich memoir breezily spun from the threads of the game's wisdom and lore did the Bambino actually write? Who knows, though Jerome Holtzman speculates in his introduction to this delicious reprint of the 1928 original that sportswriter-turned-Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick actually did the heavy lifting. Better, still, who cares? What emerges on every page is Ruth's gargantuan and all-embracing spirit.<p> A year after crunching 60 home runs, the Babe set out to make a few extra bucks by telling his story, but he tells much more than that. Despite his almost childlike persona, Ruth was a remarkably astute observer of the game and strategic tactician; he was no mere one-dimensional player. His analyses of pitching and hitting and contemporary players' talents in the field and at the plate remain as solid today as they were then. He intuited what the modern number crunchers have borne out.</p><p> As much fun as Ruth's opinionated prose still is to read, the added delight in an ancient text like this is the language itself and how it's changed in the ensuing decades. Ruth drops colloquialisms in the way he used to deposit hanging curveballs into the right-field stands; 70 years later, it's like being able to run free after hours in the Slang Museum. Well-dressed ballplayers are "the glass of fashion," a pitcher who's easy to hit is a "cousin," anyone who talks a lot is a "barber," and big boppers like the Babe weren't power hitters, they were "smart hitters" or "swing hitters," as opposed to "choke hitters"--as in choking-up on the bat, not failing in the clutch.</p><p> "I'm proud of my record in baseball," Ruth says, "and I'd be ungrateful to say otherwise. Every time I drive in a run, every time I hit a ball over the fence or hear the cheers of the bleacher fans ringing in my ears I get a great kick." Babe's <i>Own Book</i> still has a knack for giving readers a kick, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Babe Ruth&#39;s Own Book is a who&#39;s who of old-times greats--Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Rodgers Hornsby, and many others.</p><h2>Americans at War</h2><p><b>Collected here for the first time are fifteen essays that span over 100 years of American history--and the remarkable thirty-year career of America's foremost historian and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>D-Day</i>,&nbsp;<i>Undaunted Courage</i>, and <i>Citizen Soldiers</i>.</b><br><br>Stephen E.

This book explains why. Urban riots and the Tet Offensive, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, the politics of outrage and race&#x2014;all pointed to a reordering of party coalitions, of groups and regions, a hardening and widening of an ideological divide&#x2014;and to the historical importance of the 1968 election as a watershed event. <br><br><i>Resilient America</i> captures this extraordinary time in all its drama&#x2014;<br>the personalities, the politics, the parties, the events and the circumstances, from the shadow of 1964 through the primaries to the general election that pitted Richard Nixon against Hubert Humphrey, with George Wallace and Eugene McCarthy as the interlopers. Where most accounts of this pivotal year&#x2014;and the decade that followed&#x2014;emphasize the coming apart of the nation, this book focuses on the fact that because of measures taken after the election the country actually held together. An esteemed scholar of the American presidency, <br><br>Michael Nelson turns our attention to how, in spite of increasing (and increasingly vehement) differences, the parties of the time managed to make divided government work. Conventional political processes&#x2014;peaceful demonstrations, congressional legislation, executive initiatives, Supreme Court decisions, party reforms, and presidential politics&#x2014;were flexible enough to absorb most of the dissent that tore America deeply in 1968 and might otherwise have torn it apart. This fraught time, as Nelson's work clearly demonstrates, produced unity as well as results well worth noting in our current predicament.</p><p>Michael Nelson, the Fulmer Professor of Political Science at Rhodes College, is a Fellow of Southern Methodist University&#39;s Center for Presidential History and a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia&#39;s Miller Center. He is the author of numerous books, including, most recently, The American Presidency: Origins and Development, 17762011, with Sidney M.

It would also be an excellent choice for college courses in American history and political science."--<i><b>Claremont Review of Books</b></i></p><p>"The book provides a shrewd, informed, and reasoned account of intra- and inter-party politics in the 1960s."--<i><b>The Forum</b></i><br><br>"No one has plumbed as deeply into the extraordinary election year of 1968 as Michael Nelson. His <i>Resilient America</i> offers scholarly acumen, vibrant prose, and a provocative thesis. Anyone who loves to read about American politics at its most intense will be enthralled."--<b>Bruce Miroff</b>, author of <i>The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party</i></p><p>"One of America's most eminent presidential scholars takes on one of America's most contentious elections, the three-way 1968 contest among Republican Richard Nixon, Democrat Hubert Humphrey, and independent George Wallace. Nelson writes with a historian's sensibility, zeroing on key personalities and decisions, but also with a political scientist's feel for systemic developments. He argues that the culminating crisis of the late 1960s brought little immediate change to the nation's "resilient" political institutions, though it--and the winning candidate--commenced an era of divided government and intensified partisanship that still dominates the national political landscape."--<b>David Courtwright</b>, author of <i>No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America</i></p><p>"<i>Resilient America</i>, Michael Nelson's account of the 1968 presidential election, is a gem of a book. Abjuring the ideological biases that have characterized almost all accounts of that election, Nelson steps back from the fray and shows how a society stressed and torn apart by the cultural and political divisions of the sixties was kept together by the outcome of the election and the subsequent operations of the president and Congress. The big story here is that of the political system saving the society from disintegration, a remarkable achievement. It is our good fortune as well that one of America's leading scholars of the presidency is also one of our finest writers. Nelson captures the drama and passion of the campaign, and of the entire tumultuous decade of the sixties, in a compelling narrative."--<b>James W. Ceaser</b>, author of <i>Presidential Selection, Liberal Democracy and Political Science, Reconstructing America, and Nature and History in American Political Development</i></p><p>"In <i>Resilient America</i>, Michael Nelson, one of our nation's preeminent experts on the Presidency, takes a fascinating look at the pivotal 1968 election, one that in many ways created some of the contours that we see in our political scene today. Held during one of the most turbulent periods in American history, Nelson argues that whether one agrees with the outcome or not, the election served its purpose, creating some degree of resolution and stability at a time when it was so badly needed."--<b>Charles E. Cook, Jr.</b>, columnist for the <i>National Journal and editor &amp; publisher of The Cook Political Report</i></p></p><h2>Putin&#39;s Russia</h2><p><br><p>On December 31, 1999, ailing political maverick Boris Yeltsin abruptly handed the country's leadership over to the virtually unknown former intelligence officer Vladimir Putin. The new Kremlin boss represented both continuity and change. While he was linked with the past, he also signified a sharp break from it. With Putin's ascendancy to power, Russian leadership and Russia have changed dramatically. A pragmatic manager, Putin has tamed the Russian elite and arrogant tycoons, pushed forward economic reforms previously stalled under Yeltsin, and instituted a pro-Western foreign policy. He has accomplished all of this while maintaining an astonishing 70 percent approval rating. However, Russia's transformation under Putin remains a paradox. Outwardly he has proved his desire to modernize Russia, but he has also demonstrated a deep distrust of major democratic institutions and an open desire to keep tight control over society. In Putin's Russia, Lilia Shevtsova, one of Russia's top political analysts and award-winning journalists, examines how, under Putin, the country vacillates between optimism and anguish, hope and resentment. She examines the true nature of Putin's leadership and how far he is willing and capable to go with further transformation. Time will tell if he can combine his authoritarian ways with economic liberalism and pro-Western policy to define the Russia of the twenty-first century. </p><br></p><p><p><b>Lilia Shevtsova </b> co-chairs the Russian Domestic Politics and Political Institutions Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, dividing her time between the Carnegie office in Washington, D.C. and the Carnegie Moscow Center. She is author of <i>Putin's Russia</i> (2005) and <i>Yeltsin's Russia: Myths and Reality</i> (1999), and coeditor (with Archie Brown) of <i>Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Putin: Political Leadership in Russia's Transition</i> (2001), all published by the Carnegie Endowment.</p>When dark horse Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin in 2000, a virtual cipher had risen to the Russian presidency. Discerning that his two and one-half years in power have revealed Putin's personality and policies, this well-informed Russian observer offers a straightforward situation report. Attuned to Russians' attitude toward politics--they traditionally accept authoritarian leadership--Shevtsova marches through Putin's success in inducing Russia's power groups (liberals, business oligarchs, Moscow ministries, and regional governors) to fall in behind him. The copious public opinion data discussed by Shevtsova indicate acquiescence to this trend by ordinary Russians, weary of the economic vicissitudes of the uproarious 1990s. She does not, however, detect significant risk of backsliding into communist-style politics; except for a hardcore 25 percent of the populace nostalgic for the hammer and sickle, what Russians want out of Putin is a preservation of liberal freedoms, stabilization of liberal economics, a Western orientation in foreign policy, and a cessation of the war in Chechnya. Shevtsova's scorecard on these points will interest serious Russia watchers. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The greatest - the 'god of war' - is someone beyond their reach, a true anomaly of the ring. The evidence is compelling. See it and decide for yourself. This countdown of the top-ten fighters of the modern era is a literary experience like no other, and it isn't all readers will find in this book. Toledo's writing has been described as "warrior poetry"; he goes beyond the usual factoids, dry text, and threadbare yarns to conjure up legendary fighters as they were.

Award-winning boxing writer Springs Toledo calls them "gods of war" and makes a compelling case for his conclusions.

Now, with this first collection of his writings to be translated into English, the contributions of Lassus can finally be fully appreciated by a wider audience.</p><p>Perhaps best known for the speculative base that sustains his work and thought, Lassus is an artist whose philosophical concerns precede and determine his design work. For him, attention to the interactive nature of the landscape underlies all projects. He approaches each site in pursuit of the particular opportunities and challenges it presents and is ever mindful of the way in which observers will experience the space. He does not allow experience to be relegated to by-product of design. Instead, as one of his close collaborators explained, for Lassus "form is not primary, it is induced from the articulation of intention."</p><p>The essays in <i>The Landscape Approach</i> afford readers a look into some of Lassus's most important projects&#x2014;the Butterfly Bridge at Istres, the highway rest area at Nimes-Caissargues, the Park of Duisburg-Nord, the Garden of Returns for the Corderie Royale at Rochefort, and the Tuileries in Paris&#x2014;and furnish provocative insight into Lassus's unique bonding of theory and practice. As is the case with his garden designs, Bernard Lassus's volume is a true experience. It is sure to become a classic in the field.</p></p><p>In addition to his extensive work on landscape projects throughout Europe, Bernard Lassus is currently head of postgraduate research in &#34;Gardens, Landscapes, Territories&#34; at both the Paris-La Villette School of Architecture and Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and is Adjunct Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. He has received numerous awards, including the 1996 National Award for Landscape, presented by the French Ministry of the Environment, and the National Award for Heritage, from the French Ministry of Culture.<p>"In his writings, which are poetic and persuasive, Lassus often reminds us that landscape is 'a cultural reading . . . a construction of the mind. . . . Physical qualities may be more or less fixed but not their meaning, from which Lassus makes an important inference: 'To suggest a landscape, it is not therefore always necessary . . . to plant a number of trees or to widen a river.'"&#x2014;Peter Jacobs</p><br><br><p>"Lassus seeks something other than the bland schemes we hurry through and past&#x2014;a more replete landscape, in which our senses, intellect, and imagination are all brought into play."&#x2014;Andrew Mead, <i>The Architect's Journal</i></p></p><h2>Bruno (SUNY Series in Hegelian Studies)</h2><p><i>Makes Schelling&#x2019;s dialogue Bruno readily accessible to the English-language reader, with valuable commentary on the work itself, which details Schelling&#x2019;s account of his differences from Fichte.</i><br><br>F. W. J. Schelling has remained unknown to most contemporary scholars, yet his thought is of great import to early 19th century philosophy and the study of German Idealism. For the first time, Michael G. Vater makes Schelling&#x2019;s dialogue Bruno readily accessible to the English-language reader while providing valuable commentary on the work itself, which details Schelling&#x2019;s account of his differences from Fichte.<br><br>In an extensive introduction, Vater discusses the background and significance of Schelling&#x2019;s identity-philosophy and its impact on the development of Hegel&#x2019;s thought from 1802 to the publication of Hegel&#x2019;s Phenomenology. Comprehensive notes point out Schelling&#x2019;s use of classic sources, his dependence on Spinoza, and the similarities in Schelling&#x2019;s and Hegel&#x2019;s points of view during their collaboration on the Critical Journal.<br><br>Through the value of its own arguments and its influence on Hegel, Schelling&#x2019;s Bruno provides key material for the evolution on 19th century philosophy. In Schelling&#x2019;s system, Hegel found the construction of a harmonious whole in which his own basic conflicts and those of his generation found their solution. Hegel&#x2019;s Difference and Schelling&#x2019;s Bruno announce a new programme and outline its foundations: Philosophy must become metaphysical again and unify a world torn by the conflicting and one-sided ideologies of materialism and spiritualism.</p><p><p>Michael G.

Bill Bryson was struck one day by the thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles and wars of history than to considering what history really consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we live. This inspired him to start a journey around his own house, an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant, creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the corners of every home.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: Bill Bryson (<i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>) turns his attention from science to society in his authoritative history of domesticity, <i>At Home: A Short History of Private Life</i>. While walking through his own home, a former Church of England rectory built in the 19th century, Bryson reconstructs the fascinating history of the household, room by room. With waggish humor and a knack for unearthing the extraordinary stories behind the seemingly commonplace, he examines how everyday items--things like ice, cookbooks, glass windows, and salt and pepper--transformed the way people lived, and how houses evolved around these new commodities. "Houses are really quite odd things," Bryson writes, and, luckily for us, he is a writer who thrives on oddities. He gracefully draws connections between an eclectic array of events that have affected home life, covering everything from the relationship between cholera outbreaks and modern landscaping, to toxic makeup, highly flammable hoopskirts, and other unexpected hazards of fashion. Fans of Bryson's travel writing will find plenty to love here; his keen eye for detail and delightfully wry wit emerge in the most unlikely places, making <i>At Home</i> an engrossing journey through history, without ever leaving the house. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>Bill Bryson is much loved for his bestselling travel books, from The Lost Continent to Down Under, but Notes from a Small Island has earned a particularly special place in the nation&#39;s heart (a national poll for World Book Day in 2003 voted it the book that best represents Britain). His acclaimed A Short History of Nearly Everything won the Aventis Prize for Science Books and the Descartes Science Communication Prize. He has now returned to live in the UK with his wife and family. www.billbryson.co.uk</p><h2>The Golden Age: A Different Look at a Different Era</h2><p>The greatest heroes of the 1940s struggle to find their place in the postwar era as a new hero attempts to rally the nation behind his fascist agenda. &#39;</p><p>James Robinson is an acclaimed, award-winning writer whose works include STARMAN and JSA: THE GOLDEN AGE and SUPERMAN. With Geoff Johns, he was co-writer of HAWKMAN. In addition, he wrote the screenplay to <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>, starring Sean Connery, and created the acclaimed young readers comic series LEAVE IT TO CHANCE.Clearly influenced by Alan Moore's <i>Watchmen</i>, this reissue depicts DC's superheroes from the 1940s hanging up their capes following the end of WWII. Whereas Moore's superheroes were forced into retirement, here the heroes succumb to disillusionment, personality flaws and even madness. Robinson unpersuasively projects the dark pessimism of 1990s superhero comics onto the idealistic, committed heroes of half a century before. One of these "mystery men," Tex Thompson, alias the Americommando, enters politics and initiates a government project that uses atomic power to create Dynaman, a "superman" who becomes a living weapon against the Soviets. Beneath their patriotic rhetoric, Thompson and Dynaman conspire to become dictators. But Robinson never explains why the "greatest generation" that just defeated fascism abroad would embrace a homegrown version. By revealing that Thompson's and Dynaman's identities have been usurped by impostors, Robinson shies away from demonstrating how an American superhero could morph into a neo-Nazi <i>�bermensch</i>. Smith's realistic artwork and mastery of gesture and facial expression bring out all the dramatic potential in Robinson's scenario. But Darwyn Cooke's recent <i>The New Frontier</i> paints a more convincing postwar portrait of DC's superheroes. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An aristocratic Silesian, whose ancestors had faced the Mongols at Leipzig, Strachwitz first won the Iron Cross in the Great War. After fighting with the Freikorps and in between the wars, he was serving with the 1st Panzer Division when the Polish campaign inaugurated World War II.<br><br>Leading from the front, his exploits as commander of a panzer battalion earned him further decorations during the French campaign. Transferred to the newly formed 16th Panzer Division, he participated in the invasion of Yugoslavia and then Operation Barbarossa where he earned the Knight&#x2019;s Cross. The following year, during the advance on Stalingrad, he won the Oak Leaves for destroying 270 Soviet tanks at Kalach. Now commander of a regiment, he reached the Volga and fought ferociously on the northern rim of Sixth Army&#x2019;s perimeter. Severely wounded during the battles, he was flown out of the Stalingrad pocket and was thus spared the fate of the rest of Sixth Army.<br><br>Upon recuperation, he was named commander of the Grossdeutschland Division&#x2019;s panzer regiment, and won the Swords to the Knight&#x2019;s Cross during Manstein&#x2019;s counteroffensive at Kharkov. After fighting through Kursk and the ensuing defensive battles, he was transferred the next year to Army Group North where he won the Diamonds to the Knight&#x2019;s Cross at Narva.<br><br>For the rest of the war, sandwiched around a stay in hospital, he commanded ad hoc battlegroups, and pioneered the formation of &#x201c;tank hunter brigades,&#x201d; consisting of deep-penetration infantry armed with panzerfausts and other demolitions who would ambush Soviet tanks. Wounded 12 times during the war, and barely surviving a lethal car crash, he was finally able to surrender to the Americans in May 1945.<br><br>Australian author/researcher Raymond Bagdonas, though impaired by the disappearance of 16th Panzer Division&#x2019;s official records at Stalingrad, and the fact that many of the Panzer Graf&#x2019;s later battlegroups never kept them, has nevertheless written an intensely detailed account of this combat leader&#x2019;s life, as well as ferocious armored warfare in World War II.<br><br>Ray Bagdonas a retired businessman and former local Government Councilor, has had a decades long interest in WW2 particularly with the Russian Front. His other interest lies in the Military Orders and he is a Knight Commander of both the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a Knight of the Order of Mercy and the Military Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus.

Additionally, he provides numerous anecdotal information that add depth to the commentary. ... his use of appendices added greatly to the provision of information surrounding von Strachwitz&#x2019;s accomplishments. The bibliography that he provides is very useful in identifying additional sources to the reader on the various engagements in which the Panzer Graf was engaged.Bagdonas notes that von Strachwitz left no memoirs or notes; so gathering and drafting a comprehensive biography was extremely difficult...he has done a commendable job and that the book may serve future generations as an example of an individual who responded to the call of his nation twice and served in an honorable and selfless way throughout. As a leader, commander and officer, von Strachwitz was an individual to emulate.... recommend this book for its publication quality, its photo/map inserts and the information that the author provides about this noteworthy historical figure" (<i>The Military History Reviewer</i>)<br><br>"During both world wars, Germany set a very high standard for tactical leadership. This was especially true in the Soviet-German conflict, where German commanders used maneuver and coordination skills to defeat more numerous opponents. Most accounts of such victories focus on the achievements of senior leaders such as Heinz Guderian or Erich von Manstein. Except for a number of divisional histories, however, this literature is short on details about how Germans operated at tactical levels from company through regiment. Raymond Bagdonas, a self-taught Australian historian, helps fill this gap with a biography of Lt. Gen. Hyazinth, Graf von Strachwitz, the subject of at least two previous studies in German...The Devil's General provides a well written, interesting account of German tank combat against the Soviets" (<i>Michigan War Studies Review</i>)</p><h2>Clare and Her Sisters: Lovers of the Poor Christ</h2><p>In this compelling biography, Madeline Nugent unfolds the story of St. Clare and her sisters. Inspired by St. Francis and his ideal of holy poverty, Clare left everything to follow Christ. This decision meant conflict with her family and an uncertain future, but Clare never wavered. Her small group of followers took root, and the new foundation, eventually called the Poor Clares, flowered throughout the world. Nugent bases her work on extensive research, time spent in Assisi, and interviews with Franciscan experts. On this solid foundation, she builds Clare&#39;s story through vignettes of various characters, some historical, some fictional, creating an authentic biography with the appeal of a novel. Madeline Pecora Nugent, SFO, has been writing for over forty years. She is the author of many articles, booklets and a column as well as Saint Anthony: Words of Fire, Life of Light, also published by Pauline Books. She writes and publishes brief stories of patron saints, distributed through the non-profit organization Saints&#39; Stories, which she founded. A member of the Secular Franciscan Order, Mrs. Nugent holds a graduate degree in English and is a former teacher. She is a wife and mother of five children and lives in Middletown, Rhode Island.</p><p></p><h2>When Everybody Ate at Schrafft&#39;s: Memories, Pictures, and Recipes from a Very Special Restaurant Empire</h2><p>When Everybody Ate at Schrafft&#39;s is a lavishly illustrated book about the Schrafft&#39;s restaurant empire and the era in which it thrived. In the New York area alone, more than 50 stores (as they were called) dotted the urban landscape. Celebrities were frequent customers and sometimes employees, women lunched there, and businessmen conferred over cocktails. And as you&#39;ll see, everybody who ate at Schrafft&#39;s has a story to tell.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Hollow</h2><p>Still raw from the brutal slayings of his wife and daughter, and the events surrounding the capture of their killer, the travelling man, Charlie Parker retreats to the wintry Maine landscape of his childhood. By following in the steps of his beloved grandfather, Parker hopes to heal his spirit and get through the bitter anniversary of Jennifer and Susan&#39;s murder. But the echoes of the past that await him are not all benign. In a gruesome re-enactment of Bird&#39;s own nightmares, another young woman is killed with her child and his brief involvement in their lives impels Parker to hunt their vicious murderer. As the death toll mounts, Parker comes to realise that the true answer to the puzzle lies thirty years in the past, in a tree with strange fruit, in his own grandfather&#39;s history, and in the perverted desires of a monster incarnate - Caleb Kyle.</p><p>Charlie "Bird" Parker, the protagonist of John Connolly's Shamus Award-winning first novel, <i>Every Dead Thing</i>, returns in another moody, masterful thriller set in the beautifully evoked Maine woods where Bird has returned to lick his wounds and recover from the murder of his wife and daughter explored in the earlier book. A half-hearted investigator, Bird agrees to track down the ex-husband of Rita Purdue and get the child support she has coming to her. And when Rita and her son are killed and the finger of suspicion points to Billy Purdue, Bird still feels a moral obligation to find the young man, even though he can't believe he's a killer. Then the bodies begin piling up, among them a bunch of Cambodian killers, some mob-connected Boston gangsters, a couple of people to whom Billy turned for refuge, and an old woman in a nursing home who dies with the name of a bogeyman on her lips--the mysterious Caleb Kyle. It's not the first time Bird's heard that name: his grandfather, who was also a cop, spent his last years trying to track down the legendary monster whose name was always used to scare kids into doing what they were supposed to. And it's not only his grandfather's ghost that haunts Bird as he attempts to solve the mystery of who Billy Purdue really is; the spirits of his dead wife and child urge him on in his attempt to find justice for Rita and her child as well. Aided in his quest by two unlikely but compellingly realized associates, a gay hit man and his lover, Bird confronts the evil that lurks in a mythical monster who turns out to be all too real, and comes to terms, finally, with the grief that has colored his life black since the death of his family. A powerful, well-paced thriller with a complex and interesting hero who bears even further explication--hopefully in his third adventure. <i>--Jane Adams</i>John Connolly was born in Dublin in 1968. His debut -EVERY DEAD THING - swiftly launched him right into the front rank of thriller writers, and all his subsequent novels have been Sunday Times bestsellers. He is the first non-American writer to win the US Shamus award.</p><h2>101 Amazing Things to Do in Scotland: Scotland Travel Guide</h2><p><p><b>Hey there!

Why do some male types get along better with some female types? And what happens when a person, suddenly, in the middle of life, feels moved to live out a different story? You will find answers to these questions. </p> <p>This book gives you a chance to affirm the great story you have been living all your life. It tells you why you have affinities for some people more than others, and why you have made certain life choices. As a result, you will be helped to make future choices and decisions more consciously and more wisely. </p> <p>You will find this book to be a UNIQUE CLASSIC in the realms of human understanding. The concepts explained are an enhancement to (not a replacement for) virtually every theory of psychology. These include the theories of Personality Types, Emotional Intelligence, Self-Actualization, the Wisdom of the Enneagram, the MBTI, and all the rest. </p> <p>This book is about <em>archetypes</em>, unique <em>personality types</em> that comprise the Great Stories that men and women have been living from time immemorial, in every era and in every culture: <br> </p><ul> <li> For women these Stories are named: Mother, Companion, Amazon, and Mediatrix. </li> <br> <li> For men these Stories are named: Father, Seeker, Warrior, and Sage. </li> <br> <li> Each of these is a Great Story in the sense that men and women in every era have found their identity and fulfillment in living one or two of these dramas. </li> <br> <li> Our personal strengths, abilities, instincts, deficiencies, priorities and values all flow from the Great Stories that we live. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Originally, this concept of &#x201c;human archetypes&#x201d; was introduced by the psychologist Carl Jung. It has now been expanded upon and further explained in this book in a way that no other authors ever have. <br> Each of these &#x201c;archetypes&#x201d; or Great Stories for men and women refers to a pattern of psychic energy, a way of life, a way of being and becoming a fulfilled human person: <br> </p><ul> <li> Understanding your archetype is a way of understanding who you are and who you are not. </li> <br> <li> Understanding your archetype will tell you a great deal about how you relate to other women, other men, your parents, your children, your peers. </li> <br> <li> Understanding your archetype explains how you receive other people, and how others receive you. </li> <br> <li> Understanding your archetype will tell you about loving, about parenting, and even about your way of conducting business. </li> <br> <li> Marriage, the single life, midlife and old age are all affected by the Great Stories we live. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>As you read the Great Stories in this book, you will enjoy seeing yourself, your relatives and your friends in them. You will see the different ways that people live the Great Stories (archetypes), and how these stories interact with one another. </p> <p>You will enjoy the female dramas of Mother, Amazon, Companion and Mediatrix.

About Men and Women is unique in its simplicity and clarity; it is fascinating to read and visually pleasing, with its use of calligraphy and simple design. The book does a good job of describing Jung's four types (Father, Seeker, Warrior, and Sage for men; Mother, Companion, Amazon, and Mediatrix for women) and examining the predictable combinations and changes in self perception that occur as people marry, enter mid - life, and come into their own as complete, multi-faceted human beings. The powerful influence of one's parents' ``Great Story'' is also explained, and the need for developing a secondary (minor) persona is made clear with examples from actual case studies. An appendix examines the Myers-Briggs Test, which evaluates personality type. The book should prove useful to young adults curious about who they are and how to make the choices that lie before them.

The unlikely duo journeys halfway around the world to piece together an Indian prophecy, find a way to free the man trapped by a centuries-old spell, and discover the path to their true destiny.</p> <p><strong>Q&amp;A with Colleen Houck</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Who are your favorite writers?</p> <p><strong>Houck:</strong> J.K Rowling (<em>Harry Potter</em> Series), Chris Paolini (<em>Eragon</em> Series), Stephenie Meyer (<em>Twilight</em> Saga), John Steinbeck, Walter Farley, Jules Verne, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Orson Scott Card, and many more! </p><p>I was fascinated with Chris Paolini&#x2019;s story and when I found out he was such a young author and carried around his manuscript for four years before getting it published on his own, I was even more impressed with his grit and determination. The science fiction of Orson Scott Card and Jules Verne carries me away to places I never imagined. When I was young, I wanted to be Laura Ingalls and ride horses like Alec and have great adventures like they did.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Who inspired you to become a published author?</p> <p><strong>Houck:</strong> The personal stories of Stephenie Meyer and J.K. Rowling really touched me. Both women just decided one day to give writing a try and the course of their lives changed. One day I woke up and decided I was going to give it a shot, too. I always loved creative writing in middle school and high school, sci-fi and fantasy being my favorite, and have been an avid reader all my life, but I never considered it as a career. Seeing Rowling and Meyer--two self-trained writers--have the courage to give writing a try inspired me to channel my creative energy into imagining and writing the <em>Tiger&#x2019;s Curse</em> series.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In what environment do you get your best writing?</p> <p><strong>Houck:</strong> I write at my desk near a window with a great view of Oregon pine and beautiful houses. I always light a candle when I write as a reminder to include the senses of smell, touch, taste, sight, and sound in my writing. It has to be quiet and, until recently, my dog always slept at my feet. That's my comfort zone when writing. I really love writing in the afternoons because that&#x2019;s when things get quiet. In the mornings I like to write personal correspondence to people who write to me about my books and do the research on the exotic locations I write about. I walk everyday and listen to music that inspires me to keep writing, but I can't listen to music and write at the same time because I get too distracted.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> When you&#x2019;re not writing and reading your own books, what are you reading?</p> <p><strong>Houck:</strong> I&#x2019;m reading everything YA right now. My favorite books are fantasy with a touch of romance but I love Sci-Fi, children's chapter books, and mainstream fiction as well. I recently finished the Percy Jackson/Lightning Thief series which I loved and currently I&#x2019;m reading <em>The Life of Pi</em> which I originally purchased because of the tiger on the cover, but I also have shelves full of books waiting for my attention. The next books on my list include Scott Westerfield&#x2019;s <em>Uglies</em> trilogy, Alyson Noel&#x2019;s <em>Immortals</em> series, and <em>The Guardians of Gahoole</em> by Kathryn Lasky.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Anything else you want to share with Amazon shoppers?</p> <p><strong>Houck:</strong> Writing my own book was a chance to channel my inner hero. I&#x2019;m a lot like my character, Kelsey. We both have a special blanket given to us by our grandmothers, we both love chocolate, and we both sat in the back of class. But where Kelsey took a leap into the unknown as a teenager, I took a lot longer to come out of my shell. In writing this series, I&#x2019;ve been able to leap along with Kelsey.</p> <p>I also wanted to say how grateful I am to all of the Amazon readers who have left such kind and supportive customer reviews of my books. I originally self-published my first two books through Amazon and the reader comments created enough buzz to attract a film producer and interest from foreign publishers before I even had an agent, which I&#x2019;ve learned is kind of unheard of! Amazon was really the key to launching the <em>Tiger&#x2019;s Curse</em> saga and, because of that, I now have a career as a full-time writer.</p>Formerly a student at the University of Arizona Colleen Houck has worked as a nationally certified American Sign Language interpreter for seventeen years.

Yet now it seems there are no more enemies to vanquish, leaving them with a few months of welcomed garrison duty as the Riftwar rages on in the west.</p><p>When the trio is ordered to accompany a lady and her husband safely to the city of LaMut, it looks like an easy&#x2014;even cushy&#x2014;assignment. But in Midkemia, nothing is that straightforward, and the men find themselves trapped by a vicious winter storm in a castle with scheming lords and ladies, an unsolved murder, and nothing less than the political future of Midkemia at stake. . . .</p></p><p><p>Raymond E. Feist is the multiple <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author or coauthor of thirty previous books&#x2014;all but one of which are Riftwar Cycle novels. He lives in San Diego.</p>This second cowritten installment of Legends of the Riftwar (after Feist's 2006 collaboration with William R. Forstchen, Honored Enemy) finds Rosenberg's engaging mercenary trio, Durine, Kethol and Pirojil, drafted to escort the bed-hopping Lady Mondegreen and her current lover, ambitious Baron Morray, to a summit conference in the city of LaMut. As the intrigues thicken, the Three Swords find themselves permanent guards to the baron, and are soon promoted to captain and tasked with keeping the peace among bored and idle baronial retainers. Then the aging Baron Mondegreen dies, and Morray and Lady Mondegreen are found in bed together with their throats slashed. The Swords, suspicious of everybody-including one another-go looking for the murderer. The numerous characters are well-drawn and use their brains rather than relying on too-easy magic. Fans of the earlier Midkemia books and past adventures of the Three Swords (Not Exactly the Three Musketeers, etc.) will find much to enjoy in this intelligent high fantasy. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book's publication was a wish that seemed to end with Lennon's assassination in 1980 and the theft of the manuscript from the Lennons' home in 1982. When it was recovered and first published in 1986, <i>Skywriting</i> received immediate critical and popular acclaim. Filled with Lennon's extraordinary creative powers and lavishly illustrated with his own drawings, the collection reveals his fertile creative spirit up close and in full force. Included in <i>Skywriting</i> are "Two Virgins," written when the public learned that John and Yoko were living together as husband and wife, and John's only autobiography, "The Ballad of John and Yoko." In addition there are notes on his falling in love with Yoko, the breakup of the Beatles, his persecution by U.S. authorities, and his withdrawal from public life. This is a book with John Lennon's spirit on every page&#x2014;a spirit the world needs to remember. </p></p><p>&#x201c;John wrote Skywriting at a time when the world was wondering whatever happened to him. Why wasn&#x2019;t he writing songs anymore? Well, this is what he was busy doing... I&#x2019;m glad that I can now share these writings with you. I&#x2019;m sure John would be, too.&#x201d; (Yoko Ono (from the afterword))<br><br>&#x201c;Had he never sung a note, John Lennon still might have made his mark - as a successor to Lewis Carroll, James Joyce, and other brilliantly playful molders and expanders of the English language.&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times)<br><br>&#x201c;Candid and scathing...A reflection of its author&#x2019;s creativity and enduring appeal.&#x201d; (People)<br><br>&#x201c;Skywriting is a thrill... Lennon at his best.&#x201d; (San Jose Mercury News)<br><br>&#x201c;It is no wonder John Lennon&#x2019;s fans grow more in love with him as time goes by...His great influence on popular music makes him impossible to forget, so does this book.&#x201d; (Houston Chronicle)<br><br>&#x201c;Marvelous, delightful reading and for John Lennon fans a must.&#x201d; (Publishers Weekly)YA John Lennon was a paradox. Underneath the hard living celebrity persona lurked a totally different individual. His writings in Skywriting by Word of Mouth reflect the transition period during which he met Yoko Ono and realized that he wanted to leave the Beatles. He is honest about personal mistakes and his abuse of drugs. His writings are candid, witty, enlightened, and sarcastic. This book will eradicate previous perceptions since it erases the facade of John Lennon and shows his real soul. While language in certain passages may offend some readers, mature teens should benefit from Lennon's honest evaluation of his self image and his public image.

As told with wit and verve by Emily Hahn, a remarkable woman in her own right, the biography of the Soong Sisters tells the story of China through both world wars. It also chronicles the changes to Shanghai as they relate to a very eccentric family that had the courage to speak out against the ruling regime. Greatly influencing the history of modern China, they interacted with their government and military to protect the lives of those who could not be heard, and they appealed to the West to support China during the Japanese invasion.&nbsp;</p><p>A revolutionary woman for her time and an enormously creative writer, Emily Hahn broke all of the rules of the 1920s, including by traveling the country dressed as a boy, working for the Red Cross in Belgium, being the concubine to a Shanghai poet, using opium, and having a child out of wedlock. Hahn kept on fighting against the stereotype of female docility that characterized the Victorian era and was an advocate for the environment until her death at age ninety-two.<br><br> Emily Hahn (1905&#x2013;1997) was the author of fifty-two books, as well as one hundred eighty-one articles and short stories for the<i>&nbsp;New Yorker</i>&nbsp;from 1929 to 1996. She was a staff writer for the magazine for forty-seven years. She wrote novels, short stories, personal essays, reportage, poetry, history and biography, natural history and zoology, cookbooks, humor, travel, children&#x2019;s books, and four autobiographical narratives:&nbsp;<i>China to Me</i>&nbsp;(1944), a literary exploration of her trip to China;<i>&nbsp;Hong Kong Holiday</i>&nbsp;(1946);&nbsp;<i>England to Me</i>&nbsp;(1949); and&nbsp;<i>Kissing Cousins</i>&nbsp;(1958).<br><br> The fifth of six children, she was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and later became the first woman to earn a degree in mining engineering at the University of Wisconsin. She did graduate work at both Columbia and Oxford before leaving for Shanghai. She lived in China for eight years. Her wartime affair with Charles Boxer, Britain&#x2019;s chief spy in pre&#x2013;World War II Hong Kong, evolved into a loving and unconventional marriage that lasted fifty-two years and produced two daughters. Emily Hahn&#x2019;s final published piece in the<i>&nbsp;New Yorker</i>&nbsp;appeared in 1996, shortly before her death.</p><h2>Listen to the Landscape</h2><p>Mirroring the human response to the natural world, this book is a rare synthesis of stunning landscape photography and understated haiku poetry.

He came to America and grew up in Cleveland&#x2014;stealing cars, rolling drunks, battling priests, nearly going to jail. He became the screenwriter of the worldwide hits <i>Basic Instinct,</i> <i>Jagged Edge</i>, and <i>Flashdance. </i>He also wrote the legendary disasters <i>Showgirls</i> and <i>Jade</i>.<i> </i>The rebellion never ended, even as his films went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the box office and he became the most famous&#x2014;or infamous&#x2014;screenwriter in Hollywood. <br><br>Joe Eszterhas is a complex and paradoxical figure: part outlaw and outsider combined with equal parts romantic and moralist. More than one person has called him &#x201c;the devil.&#x201d; He has been referred to as &#x201c;the most reviled man in America.&#x201d; But <i>Time</i> asked, &#x201c;If Shakespeare were alive today, would his name be Joe Eszterhas?&#x201d; and he was the first screenwriter picked as one of the movie industry&#x2019;s 100 Most Powerful People. Although he is often accused of sexism and misogyny, his wife is his best friend and equal partner. Considered an apostle of sex and violence, he is a churchgoer who believes in the power of prayer. For many years the ultimate symbol of Hollywood excess, he has moved his family to Ohio and immersed himself in the midwestern lifestyle he so values. <br><br>Controversial, fearless, extremely talented, and totally unpredictable, the author of the best-selling <i>American Rhapsody</i> and National Book Award nominee <i>Charlie</i> S<i>impson&#x2019;s Apocalypse </i>has surprised us yet again: he has written a memoir like no other.<br><br>On one level, <i>Hollywood Animal</i> is a shocking and often devastating look inside the movie business.

Into this rich work of the imagination, Atwood brings her brilliant insights into the relationships between men and women and between the society of the entitled and those without position.</p><p>In 1843, a 16-year-old Canadian housemaid named Grace Marks was tried for the murder of her employer and his mistress. The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Yet opinion remained fiercely divided about Marks--was she a spurned woman who had taken out her rage on two innocent victims, or was she an unwilling victim herself, caught up in a crime she was too young to understand? Such doubts persuaded the judges to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, and Marks spent the next 30 years in an assortment of jails and asylums, where she was often exhibited as a star attraction. In <i>Alias Grace</i>, Margaret Atwood reconstructs Marks's story in fictional form. Her portraits of 19th-century prison and asylum life are chilling in their detail. The author also introduces Dr. Simon Jordan, who listens to the prisoner's tale with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. In his effort to uncover the truth, Jordan uses the tools of the then rudimentary science of psychology. But the last word belongs to the book's narrator--Grace herself."Brilliantly realized, intellectually provocative and maddeningly suspenseful."<br>-<i>Maclean's</i><p>"Written by a great novelist whose capacity to surprise, to challenge and to infuse her fictions with the surge and pulse of existence never fails."<br>-<i>The Times</i></p></p><h2>Blood in the Forest: The End of the Second World War in the Courland Pocket</h2><p>Blood in the Forest tells the brutal story of the forgotten battles of the final months of the Second World War. While the eyes of the world were on Hitler&#x2019;s bunker, more than half a million men fought six cataclysmic battles along a front line of fields and forests in Western Latvia known as the Courland Pocket. Just an hour from the capital Riga, German forces bolstered by Latvian Legionnaires were cut off and trapped with their backs to the Baltic. The only way out was by sea: the only chance of survival to hold back the Red Army. Forced into uniform by Nazi and Soviet occupiers, Latvian fought Latvian &#x2013; sometimes brother against brother. Hundreds of thousands of men died for little territorial gain in unimaginable slaughter. When the Germans capitulated, thousands of Latvians continued a war against Soviet rule from the forests for years afterwards. An award-winning documentary journalist, the author travels through the modern landscape gathering eye-witness accounts from seventy years before piecing together for the first time in English the stories of those who survived. He meets veterans who fought in the Latvian Legion, former partisans and a refugee who fled the Soviet advance to later become President, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, A survivor of the little-known concentration camp at Popervale and founder of Riga&#x2019;s Jewish Museum, Margers Vestermanis has never spoken about his personal experiences. Here he gives details of the SS new world order planned in Kurzeme, his escape from a death march and subsequent survival in the forests with a Soviet partisan group - and a German deserter. With eyewitness accounts, detailed maps and expert contributions alongside rare newspaper archive, photographs from private collections and extracts from diaries translated into English from Latvian, German and Russian, the author assembles a ghastly picture of death and desperation in a tough, uncomfortable story of a nation both gripped by war and at war with itself.</p><p>Vincent Hunt is a documentary journalist and award-winning BBC producer. Crossing Latvia interviewing people who suffered at the hands of the KGB or fought against their system of totalitarian control he sets the political and social context of what Communism actually meant in this Baltic state: interrogation, surveillance, deportation and often death. This is his second book about Latvia&#x2019;s recent history, following on from Blood in the Forest - the end of the Second World War in the Courland Pocket (Helion 2017) which detailed the six desperate battles by German and Latvian forces to halt the Red Army advance into Latvia. His work explores pan-generational trauma, forgiveness and legacy, with the journey to see the landscape now an important part of understanding sorrow, loss and memorial for those left behind. His first book Fire and Ice (The History Press, 2014) was a journey across Arctic Norway meeting people affected by the Nazi scorched earth retreat of 1944 and the forced evacuation of the region. Along the way he discovered the shocking stories of 13,700 Soviet prisoners worked to death in sub-zero conditions or murdered by their Nazi captors."I wasn't even born when the newspapers heralded the very end of the second world war, but I'm willing to bet there was little or no mention of the Latvian affair, as uncovered by journalist Vincent Hunt. In fact, the hundred of thousands of Latvian and Red Army soldiers who died in the dying months of the war, must have bolstered by a considerable amount the final number of casualties of the conflict! Well written, compelling drama, made all the more readable by the author's persistence in uncovering eye-witness accounts of what actually happened." (<i>Books Monthly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c; ... The author's skilled use of interviews combined with his personal travelogue makes it one of the best books I have read in a number of years, as it successfully brings the long lasting impact of war on the Latvian people into stark focus. I look forward to reading more titles from Vincent Hunt in the future.&#x201d; (<i>Recollections of WW2</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Hunt has produced a comprehensive work, extensively researched and well worth the read...

She never spoke about him, let alone made contact with him while at her place of work. But often on returning home at night to her narrow house in Mackerel Lane, Miss Bunch would hurry to let the dog out into the back garden. After fetching him back in for his supper she would sit down to her own plain meal. Glad to be done with the dishes, she would comb her hair in the mirror above the tiny fireplace, because even a stout, no-nonsense woman wants to make the most of herself for the one who holds the key to her heart. Then she would sit down in her easy chair, pick up a volume that she had left lying open on the lamp table, and breathlessly turn a page. Within moments she would hear his footsteps. He was with her once again, murmuring endearments in his deep, caressing voice and instantly putting her loneliness to flight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes he wore a cloak lined with moonlight, a Regency rake in a curly-brimmed hat with silver spurs on his mirror-bright boots. On other visits, his saturnine features were obscured by a highwayman&#x2019;s mask and his vibrant hair constrained by a carelessly knotted riband. At his throat cascaded a jabot of finest French lace and in his breeches&#x2019; pocket lay a strand of purloined pearls. Occasionally he came as an Arabian sheikh with a penchant for stirring up sandstorms in his desert domain. A man who could change the course of history by the raising of one dark, sardonic eyebrow and whose smile would melt the snows of Kilimanjaro.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout all the years of their relationship, Miss Bunch had known him in a myriad of guises and by many different names. But one thing never changed. He was the most faithful of lovers, forever waiting in the shadowy corners of her mind until they might next be together. And the only blight upon her secret happiness had come in recent days, when the big black dog would whimper pitifully while attempting to burrow under her chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter<br> 1<br> &nbsp;<br> The Chitterton Fells library is a friendly Tudor building on the corner of Market Street and Spittle Lane. A week rarely goes by when I don&#x2019;t go there at least once. Even when I am not caught up with my reading I like to visit old favourites on the shelves&#x2014;rather as if they are dear ones now living in a nursing home&#x2014;to let them know Ellie Haskell hasn&#x2019;t forgotten them. So I am in a position to report that our library plays host to an inviting selection of well-dusted books, a marble bust of William Shakespeare, and a curmudgeonly ghost.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story bandied about our seaside village is that Hector Rigglesworth, a widower and tea salesman by trade, did when on the brink of death at the tail end of the nineteenth century curse the library and vow to haunt its stacks until a just vengeance was achieved in reparation for his earthly suffering.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to our librarian, the malcontent Mr. Rigglesworth was father to seven spinster daughters, all of whom remained under his roof, growing more querulous by the hour. The girls, as they were known in the village even after their hair had collectively turned grey, had never lacked for suitors when young. But, alas, a man never appeared on the doorstep of Tall Chimneys who was not found wanting in one particular or another. The curate blew his nose in public, the bank clerk had a twitch, the police constable guffawed, and so it went on, until Hector Rigglesworth reached the unassailable conclusion that his daughters&#x2019; heads had been filled with romantic rubbish as a result of the books they were forever borrowing from the library.<br> &nbsp;<br> What flesh-and-blood man could compete on an equal footing with swashbucklers or Regency beaus? So, as the seven girls changed from promising to menopausal, Hector Rigglesworth toiled up- and downstairs with endless cups of tea or tended to the housewifely duties that had fallen to his lot&#x2014;the maid having married one of the rejected suitors. Poor Mr. Rigglesworth. He grew increasingly embittered. His burden was made the heavier during his declining years by being routinely dispatched to the library to collect the breathlessly awaited novels by favoured authors. The girls, understandably, were unable to go themselves in case the likes of Mr. Rochester or Mr. Darcy should show up with a special license and a couple of railway tickets to Gretna Green.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was after heading home to Tall Chimneys through the puddling rain on a dreary May afternoon (it had been an unreasonably wet month) that the beleaguered papa suffered a bout of pneumonia and in his final ramblings (as witnessed by the doctor in attendance) did speak the words that were to echo grimly down the years:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I, Hector Rigglesworth, being of sound mind, do lay my curse upon Chitterton Fells Library. May dry rot and woodworm prove its ruination and, as a further manifestation of ill will, my spirit shall roam its rooms and corridors until the day comes when I am avenged.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Inevitably there were people&#x2014;most commonly of the male persuasion&#x2014;who regarded the Rigglesworth legend as mere twaddle. These naysayers were not afraid to enter the library when the moon was full and crows gathered in a black cloud upon the bleached boughs of the blighted oak. It bothered them not if the tree&#x2019;s tendrils were wont to tap eerily upon the window of the second-floor reading room. But, surprisingly, support for the Rigglesworth ghost was found among the purportedly sane. Brigadier Lester-Smith who, at sixty-five, was by no means in his dotage, had publicly wagered his pension that the spirit had been present at many a Thursday-night meeting of the Library League.<br> &nbsp;<br> The brigadier, adhering rigidly to the principle that punctuality is the eleventh commandment, was always first to arrive for these meetings, which were held in the reading room. He had taken upon himself the responsibility of percolating the coffee and setting out the cups and saucers. He had even on one occasion brought with him a packet of ginger nuts. This treat had been much appreciated by the group&#x2014;excepting Mr. Gladstone Spike (our clergywoman&#x2019;s husband) who more often than not turned up with one of his feathery-light sponge cakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is my understanding that in years gone by, before the advent of the wireless, let alone the television set, the Library League had numbered as many as thirty persons. Nowadays Brigadier Lester-Smith might optimistically expect to find himself in the company of seven fellow members on a Thursday night, including myself.</p><h2>Voices of the Winds: Native American Legends</h2><p>Indian legends describe the beauty of the natural world, the creation, the origin of fire, historical events, and spiritual truths</p><p>Traditional stories from 60 native cultures of North America are prefaced by brief headnotes. Sources include government documents, periodicals, histories, and field research (some conducted by Clark). Familiar (Iroquois, Abenaki, Cherokee, Cheyenne) and rarely anthologized (Wasco, Pomo, Yakut, Sanpoil) stories contain archetypical symbols of universal human experience but are arranged regionally instead of thematically, as in Richard Erdoes and Alfonso Ortiz's American Indian Myths and Legends ( LJ 11/15/84). Native American cultures value an end to isolation and the individuals's return to family and tribe, but there are some striking analogs to Western myths; one Pima story neatly parallels the Noah's ark tale. Curiosities include "She-Who-Changeth" for the more common "Changing Woman," gender-exclusive language (" . . . man first appeared . . . "), and a claim that Navajos live today in prosperity.<br><i>- Rhoda Carroll, Vermont Coll., Montpelier</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Midnight Express</h2><p>A young man with a naive sense of being indestructible, comes up against reality in a foreign jail.

Recommended to any fan who isn't an incurable sourpuss. -- <i>New York Newsday</i>Miaowara Tomokato, the feline whose tongue is sharper than his sword, returns for a fifth engagement in this series by Rogers (The Sword of Samurai Cat, 1991, etc.). This time, Tomokato and his nephew, Shiro, take on the heroes of the silver screen in a sequence of parodies of American film favorites. Pursued throughout by the Terminator, Shiro races through the land of Oz, to Zirconsville, where he encounters the wizard, who wears a KKK hood (``Nobody told me he was a Grand Wizard''), and is told that in order to return home, he must steal a tanker of topsoil from the Wicked Witch of the Southeast. Rescued from the mess by Tomokato, Shiro moves on to a parody of the Seven Samurai, then finds himself on board the Starship Eisenhower, with its crew, Captain Paunch, First Officer Spocky, and Chief Cleavage Officer Lt. O'Hara. Tomokato and Shiro's adventures end with an encounter with their guardian angel, Henry, who tries to protect them from the likes of cannibal Hasdrubal Lectern and Ubersaurus Rex, and, of course, the Terminator, who pursues them still. Rogers fans will find this wacky, zany, hilarious. Others may well find it mind-numbingly silly and occasionally offensive. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

New York (1985)</p><p></p><h2>Wonder Woman: Eyes of the Gorgon</h2><p>While Diana tries to avert war at the White House, Medousa shows up and turns Wonder Woman&#39;s world upside-down. Wonder Woman must make a terrible sacrifice to defeat the Gorgon and prove herself to her JLA comrades and the world.</p><p>Grade 7 Up Earth's most famous Amazon is back, and this time she's up against Medousa. The enemy of my enemy is my friend philosophy makes unlikely allies of such characters as Circe, Medousa, and Dr. Veronica Cale, who pool their abilities to harm Diana as much as possible. At the same time, the gods pull lots of strings behind the scenes to serve their own agendas. During the course of this book, Diana is buried in rubble, bitten by Medousa's snakes, and beaten and bloodied numerous times. Most horrifying, though, is the moment when she destroys her own eyes with acid rather than risk being turned to stone. Diana's JLA confederates make brief appearances, primarily in the scene in which they test her abilities after she has been blinded. Luckily, her superhuman hearing enables her to hold her own. In fact, she's able to withstand all of their attacks, up to and including a bullet fired by Superman (she deflects it with her enchanted bracelets, in case you were wondering). It's good that Diana gets in this practice, because her final task is to serve as Athena's champion and fight Zeus's champion Briareros, a gigantic hundred-armed monstrosity that towers over her. Readers will fly through the pages to see what challenges Diana will face, and several cliff-hangers will have them clamoring for the next book.<i> Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In this long, well-plotted story arc (continued by <i>Land of the Dead</i>), Wonder Woman, aka Diana, is faced with challenges on every level. The Amazon island Themyscira, no longer floating above the ocean, now rests off the coast of the Carolinas, which brings up all sorts of U.S. security issues that Diana, as official Amazonian ambassador, must deal with. Unknown to her, the deadly gorgon Medousa and her evil sisters have been released and want revenge against the goddess Athena and her champion, Wonder Woman. At the same time, Athena plots a bloodless coup against Zeus for the rule of Mount Olympus. Medousa challenges Diana to a fight to the death, and in order to beat the gorgon's deadly gaze, Diana blinds herself. While Wonder Woman triumphs, the cost--the life of her friends' young son--is almost too much for her to bear. Then, Athena herself calls upon the still-blind Wonder Woman to help her cement her power on Olympus. Rucka serves up an exhilarating adventure while still allowing us to see the classic superheroine's softer side. His Wonder Woman still packs a punch but also comes across as very human.

The first submarine sinking of the war was by a Type VII boat, and some of the most dramatic events of the first year of the war involved a Type VII - the sinking of HMS Courageous by U29 in the Atlantic in September 1939 and the sinking of HMS Royal Oak by U47 in Scapa Flow a few weeks later. The &#39;Anatomy of the Ship&#39; series aims to provide the finest documentation of individual ships and ship types ever published. What makes the series unique is a complete set of superbly executed line drawings, both the conventional type of plan as well as explanatory views, with fully descriptive keys. These are supported by technical details and a record of the ship&#39;s service history.</p><p>David Westwood is a leading authority on U-boats during the Second World War.

Uris's thirteen novels sold millions of copies, spent months on the best-seller lists, appeared in fifty languages, and have been adapted into equally popular movies and TV miniseries. Few other writers equaled Uris's fame in the mid-twentieth century. His success fueled the rise of mass-market paperbacks, movie tie-ins, and celebrity author tours. Beloved by the public, Uris was, not surprisingly, dismissed by literary critics. Until now, his own life&#x2014;as full of drama as his fiction&#x2014;has never been the subject of a book.</p><p>In Leon Uris: Life of a Best Seller, Ira Nadel traces Uris from his disruptive youth to his life-changing experiences as a marine in World War II. These experiences, coupled with Uris's embrace of his Judaism and desire to write, led to his unprecedented success and the lavish excesses of a career as a best-selling author. Nadel reveals that Uris lived the adventures he described, including his war experiences in the Pacific (Battle Cry), life-threatening travels in Israel (Exodus), visit to Communist Poland (Mila 18), libel trial in Britain (QB VII), and dangerous sojourn in fractious Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic (Trinity). Nadel also demonstrates that Uris's talent for writing action-packed, yet thoroughly researched, novels meshed perfectly with the public's desire to revisit and understand the tumultuous events of recent history. This made him far more popular (and wealthy) than more literary authors, while paving the way for writers such as Irving Wallace and Tom Clancy.</p></p><p>IRA NADEL is Professor of English and Distinguished University Scholar at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and winner of the Medal for Canadian Biography. His books include Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen, Double Act: A Life of Tom Stoppard, Ezra Pound: A Literary Life, and David Mamet: A Life in the Theatre, which was selected by the Times of London as one of the seven best books in theatre and film for 2008.Never especially popular with the critics, Leon Uris was one of the biggest-selling writers of the 20th century (Battle Cry; Exodus; Trinity). Nadel doesn't overpraise his subject's writing, which he calls inept, but says Uris's blend of historical research, larger-than-life heroes fighting injustice, and romance thrilled readers. Uris (1924&#x2013;2003) was as feisty as any of his fictional creations. A high school dropout who couldn't wait to join the Marines after Pearl Harbor, and largely self-taught, Uris certainly demonstrated that living well is the best revenge. Working in the movies, he had a love-hate relationship with Hollywood: lapping up the pay and glamour at first as the routine helped discipline his writing, but ultimately souring on the experience. (He was fired from the film Exodus by Otto Preminger and from Topaz by Hitchcock.) Uris's personal life tracked a similar pattern of honeymoon period followed by aggressive knockdowns from the pedestal. He had a lousy relationship with his Russian-Jewish immigrant father--a disillusioned former Communist--and worrying, guilt-creating mother, and three failed marriages, one of which ended with his wife's suicide. Nadel (Ezra Pound: A Literary Life) serves up an almost breathless, informative account of the surface events of his subject's life. 31 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"You are the one. It is the appointed time, M'k'n'zy, and your responsibility. I can't believe that you would want to shirk it." </p><p>M'k'n'zy strode back and forth apprehensively within the confines of his fairly modest hut. His long black hair was tied back, although a few stray strands dangled around the twenty-year-old's face. The scar that ran the length of his right cheek had flushed bright red, as it tended to do when there was something truly frustrating facing him. </p><p>Sh'nab couldn't quite understand what M'k'ntzy's problem was. One of the tribal elders of Calhoun, Sh'nab had seen M'k'n'zy face down entire troops of Danteri oppressors. He had seen him command troops of men, send them into battle, fight for his life. He had witnessed M'k'ntzy dealing with every sort of challenge and problem under the Xenexian sun, and therefore could not wrap himself around M'k'n'zy's current problem. After all . . . </p><p>"She's just a woman, M'k'n'zy!" Sh'nab said, for what seemed to him to be the umpteenth time. "This should not be difficult for you. You are acting as if...as if . . ." He shook his head in frustration. "I don't know how you're acting. I am frankly not certain what to make of it." </p><p>"Why can't D'ndai do it!" M'k'n'zy said, annoyed with the sound of his own voice. He sounded whining, petulant, and even -- gods help him -- scared. </p><p>"Because," Sh'nab said patiently, "D'ndai isn't here. You know that. He's on Danter at the moment, paving the way for the peace negotiations with the Federation overseeing the process. You know this." </p><p>It was true, of course. He had been there, after all, when the Federation had first shown up on Xenex in the person of Jean-Luc Picard, the man who had suggested to M'k'n'zy that he himself consider a career in Starfleet. Considering M'k'n'zy's frame of mind at that moment, perhaps the thing to do was to find out when the next shuttle was going to be available and to head straight out as soon as possible. But M'k'n'zy had not made up his mind yet as to whether Starfleet was the direction that he wanted to go with his life. Never before, though, had he regretted hesitating over a decision as much as he regretted it now. </p><p>"We can wait until he comes back, then," M'k'n'zy suggested. </p><p>Sh'nab shook his head. "The times are very proscribed for these matters, M'k'n'zy. Catrine's husband has been gone a year. She has not remarried; she has had no wish to, and that is her right by tribal law. But she maintains her husband's name, and her husband's fortunes, and she does not wish the family line to end with her. That is also her right." </p><p>"But I'm the warlord! I'm not the chief. D'ndai is the chief!" </p><p>"You are his brother. These responsibilities run along family lines. You know that?" </p><p>"Yes, yes, I know, I know," M'k'n'zy's purple eyes flickered with frustration. "Sh'nab, will you please stop telling me things I already know and reminding me that I know them? It's most irritating to me!" He paced back and forth. "Can she wait until?" </p><p>"We're going in circles, M'k'n'zy! Besides, she?" Sh'nab paused. </p><p>"She what?" </p><p>Sh'nab muttered something that M'k'n'zy didn't quite hear, and when asked to repeat it, said, "I said she asked for you specifically. If she wanted to be flexible, she could likely wait until D'ndai's return, but it would put her beyond her current fertile cycle and she'd have to wait three months. She said she did not wish to wait, and she made it quite clear that she found you more...desirable...than D'ndai. I would ask that you do not pass that information on to your older brother. He might be hurt." </p><p>"Fine, fine," M'k'n'zy said with an annoyed wave. "Not a word." </p><p>"M'k'n'zy," Sh'nab said, not unkindly, "I admit that I am so accustomed to seeing you handle virtually any situation, that I'm not used to seeing you act like...well, like a nervous young man. You are, after all, only twenty summers old, even though you have served to liberate your people from an oppression that has gone on for centuries. Catrine is older than you, granted, but she is a comely woman nonetheless. It's not as if the task that awaits you is unpleasant. And it is not as if you have not . . ." </p><p>And then his voice trailed off as he saw M'k'n'zy's back stiffen slightly. "M'k'n'zy," he asked, with growing suspicion in his voice, "You have been with other women, have you not?" </p><p>M'k'n'zy laughed contemptuously. "Of course I have. I have had...dalliances, if you will. Experience." </p><p>"How much experience?" </p><p>"More than enough." </p><p>"M'k'n'zy," Sh'nab said, beginning to fully comprehend the situation, "I'm not speaking now of simple pleasure-giving. Of groping beneath sheets, or stolen moments in the darkness of a tent. Have you ever actually . . ." He found the resolve of his question beginning to fail under the intense glare and scrutiny of the look that M'k'n'zy was now giving him. He cleared his throat loudly and said, "Have you ever fully...well...consummated?" </p><p>There was silence in the hut for a time, and then M'k'n'zy said slowly, "Define 'fully.'" </p><p>"Oh gods, you're a virgin," Sh'nab moaned, sinking into a large, ornately carved chair. </p><p>"Only partly," M'k'n'zy replied defensively. </p><p>"Partly! One cannot partly be a virgin, M'k'n'zy! I don't believe this!" said Sh'nab. "A twenty-year-old warlord virgin?" </p><p>"Say it a bit more loudly. I don't think they heard you on Danter," M'k'n'zy told him with undisguised annoyance. </p><p>"M'k'n'zy, I don't understand! Every time you'd walk through the village square, women's heads would turn! Do you think a village elder doesn't notice such things? I was knocked aside once by three young girls who were trying to get your attention! How can you still have no carnal knowledge of women? The average Xenexian male is sexually active by the time he has seen thirteen summers." </p><p>"It was my choice, Sh'nab." </p><p>"I...I see." </p><p>Sh'nab was silent for so long that M'k'n'zy turned to look at him with concern on his face. "Do you?"' </p><p>"Of course I do. It saddens me, I admit. But...perhaps it's understandable. Perhaps that is why you are so able to lead troops of men into battle. You are more...comfortable...with them." </p><p>It took a moment for what Sh'nab was saying to sink in, and when he realized, M'k'n'zy wasn't sure whether to react with outrage or laughter. His voice caught somewhere in between in a sort of strangled choke. "I do not prefer to have sex with men, Sh'nab!" </p><p>"Oh," Sh'nab said mildly. "I thought that was what you were trying to say." </p><p>"If I had been trying to say that, I would have said that! Kindly do not 'help' me with a pronouncement of that magnitude, if it is all the same to you! All right?" </p><p>"Well, then I do not understand, M'k'n'zy. If you don't...I mean...if . . ." </p><p>Sh'nab was still seated in the ornately carved chair as M'k'n'zy sank onto the floor opposite him. M'k'n'zy had known Sh'nab for many years, felt a closeness to the elder who had on a number of occasions schooled him in some of the gentler arts of Xenexian life and culture. M'k'n'zy was not comfortable discussing such matters with anyone, really, but if he was going to speak of it, then at least Sh'nab was someone he considered an appropriate sounding board. </p><p>"Sh'nab, I did not expect to survive the uprising. Do you understand? I did not think that I would manage to live through the rebellion. I thought the Danteri would catch and kill me, or that I would die in battle. I faced death a thousand times, and to some degree I still cannot believe that I survived it all when so many others who were just as brave, just as resourceful, and just as skilled in battle as I wound up losing their lives. I saw the way women looked at me, Sh'nab. If it wasn't lost on you, it certainly wasn't lost on me. I'd see the lovelight in their eyes, and I...I did not desire any woman to form an attachment to me, for fear of not being there for her. I did not want any loved ones because I did not wish to leave a loved one behind. It might have hampered me in what I needed to do, and it would have been unfair to her. So now we are faced with a possible peace, and I find the prospect of...of intimacy...to be somewhat daunting. For that matter, I am suspicious of women." </p><p>"Suspicious of them?" </p><p>"Well," M'k'n'zy shrugged, "it is unfair, I suppose, to single them out. I am suspicious of everyone. But now I have a reputation as our greatest fighter, our greatest warrior. What if a woman is attracted to my title and reputation, rather than to me, for myself? For that matter, what if she expects me to be as...as skilled in the art of lovemaking as I am in the art of war? What if" -- and he lowered his head -"what if I cannot perform to her satisfaction? What if I cannot perform at all? Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the things that would be said as word spread? People calling out to me, 'So, M'k'n'zy, having problems getting your sword out of its sheath, eh?' The humiliation of the thought, the . . ." He shuddered, his voice trailing off in contemplation of such embarrassment. </p><p>"M'k'n'zy," Sh'nab said softly, "you are a strategist. That has always been your greatest strength. As such, it has been necessary for you to give a great deal of thought to whatever situation you might be faced with. In my opinion, you are treating the prospect of sex with the same gravity that you would plan a military engagement. You are trying to foresee all possibilities, plan for every possible contingency. Intimacy is not a war, M'k'n'zy." </p><p>"I know of some couples who might disagree with you, Sh'nab." </p><p>Sh'nab allowed a smile. "All right, I'll grant you that," said the elder.

Seeing this as a great opportunity to start over again, they decide to cash in their savings and buy an abandoned house for 35,000 in Detroit, the largest city in the United States to declare bankruptcy.<br></p><p>As she and her husband restore the 1914 Georgian Revival, a stately brick house with no plumbing, no heat, and no electricity, Amy finds a community of Detroiters who, like herself, aren't afraid of a little hard work or things that are a little rough around the edges. Filled with amusing and touching anecdotes about navigating a real-estate market that is rife with scams, finding a contractor who is a lover of C.S. Lewis and willing to quote him liberally, and neighbors who either get teary-eyed at the sight of newcomers or urge Amy and her husband to get out while they can, Amy writes evocatively about the charms and challenges of finding her footing in a city whose future is in question. Detroit Hustle is a memoir that is both a meditation on what it takes to make a house a home, and a love letter to a much-derided city.</p></p><p><b>Amy Haimerl</b> is a professor of journalism at Michigan State University and covers small business and urban policy for Fortune, Reuters and the New York Times.

It is Stanley&#x2019;s turn to take the class pet home for the weekend. He can&#x2019;t wait to show Figgy to his mother and spend some quality time taking care of the bird. But when Figgy flies the coop, Stanley is faced with a very tricky problem. What to do? And whose fault is it, really &#x2014; his, for agreeing to open Figgy&#x2019;s cage, which he knew was a bad idea, or Larry Finchfeather&#x2019;s for suggesting it? In this third story about the lovably earnest Stanley Birdbaum, everyone&#x2019;s favorite hamster once again finds a way to make things right &#x2014; with a little help from his friends.</p><p>Barney Saltzberg is the author-illustrator of two other much-loved books about Stanley Birdbaum. He also created CORNELIUS P. MUD, ARE YOU READY FOR BED? and CORNELIUS P. MUD, ARE YOU READY FOR SCHOOL?, among many other titles. Barney Saltzberg lives in Los Angeles.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;In <i>Crazy Hair Day</i> (2003) and <i>Star of the Week</i> (2006, both Candlewick), Stanley landed in awkward situations, but all was happily resolved with the aid of his kind and insightful teacher, Mr. Winger. While this book follows the same formula, the result is problematic. Stanley finally gets to take the class pet home for the weekend. Persuaded by his friend Larry that the bright green bird needs exercise, Stanley opens the cage door and Figgy escapes, never to return. At first Stanley blames Larry, but he eventually accepts responsibility, and both boys apologize to Mr. Winger. At his suggestion, the children share a few fond memories of the bird and then the class replaces him with not one but four new pets. On the last spread, Figgy is pictured against a serene blue background enjoying his new life in a tree with other birds. First, allowing a pet to go home with a child who does not have a clear idea of how to care for it is tantamount to abuse. Second, domestic pets released into the wild rarely survive; Stanley's actions have probably killed the bird, and picturing Figgy enjoying his freedom is misleading. Third, the idea that living things are so easily replaced does not sit well.&#x2014;<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But because of his unsurpassed skill and innocent faith, he has been betrayed. Now it&#39;s the final game of the season, and Billy&#39;s got one last chance to prove who he is and what he can do, a chance to prove what really matters in this life. A taut, compelling story of one man&#39;s coming of age, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is Michael Shaara&#39;s final novel, the classic finish to a brilliantly distinguished literary career.</p><p>Serious sports novels often fall through the literary cracks simply because of the arena they play in. Michael Shaara earned his battle stripes--and a Pulitzer Prize--for <i>The Killer Angels</i>, a fictional resurrection of the Battle of Gettysburg, as serious a subject as a writer can confront. Yet, it's no more profound, in the end, than the personal dilemmas protagonist Billy Chapel faces in this, Shaara's final novel, found stashed in a desk after his death and published posthumously.<p> A certain Hall of Famer, Chapel is a major-league anomaly, a contemporary throwback to another sporting era. He's pitched 17 stellar seasons for the same club, and his love of the game has remained paramount; neither money nor fame has been his motivation. But on the single day this story takes place, he finds himself in crisis. At the crossroads of his life, his career, and his future, he must make the hard choices that will define the direction of the rest of his life. It's the end of the season, his team's out of contention, there's a rumor he may have been traded, and the woman he can't fully acknowledge that he loves announces she's leaving him. It is, as he tells himself, "Time to grow up, Daydreamer." Still, he dreams, but he also acts. As Billy takes the mound for his final start of the year--and maybe forever--we enter his stream of consciousness, and rush with him over the sometimes treacherous rapids of what has preceded this moment, and what may come. Amazingly, though his mind seems to wander through time, his concentration is fierce. Pitch by pitch, inning by inning, he remains focused, honoring his job and his legacy as he pitches a masterpiece of mythic proportion, ultimately leaving the field more a man than when he took it. Using baseball to sound the depths of human experience, Shaara delivers a masterpiece, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>"Moving, beautiful . . .

Did the notorious silences about the Nazis on Rome's part undermine its claims to moral authority? These questions have not been raised neutrally. Spiced by speculation, polemic has focused on "Hitler's Pope": Pius XII (1939-58). It has not been known that, long before he was crowned, during the 1930s, a condemnation of the moral and doctrinal errors of National Socialism was prepared by the Holy See. That condemnation was couched in terms intelligible to Adolf Hitler, such as the following:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> The Church condemns as heretical the opinion that human nature is not essentially the same in all people, but that mankind which now inhabits the earth is composed of races so different from one another that the lowest of them is even further from the highest race than it is from the highest kind of animal that resembles man. </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Had this sentence been made public, it is certain that Hitler would have recognized the damned opinion because he had expressed it himself in his "victory speech" held before the congress of the National Socialist Party on November 3, 1933. The F�hrer would no doubt have reacted with rage to criticism by the Church, for racism was a cardinal doctrine in the Nazi creed.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The Vatican's plans were far-reaching. Aimed at views stated in <i>Mein Kampf</i> and in Hitler's other writings or speeches, they struck at such fundamental elements in the ideology of National Socialism as "blood" and its "purity": "The Church condemns the view that any mixture of blood with a foreign and inferior race, in particular a mixture of the Arian with the Semitic race, is, by reason of that mixture alone, a most heinous crime against nature and marks a grave fault in the conscience."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Nor did the attack on Hitler stop there. His ideas and those of other Nazi leaders on subjects ranging from "eugenics" to sterilization, from education to leadership and individual rights, were damned by the Vatican in successive drafts:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> All people about whom there are grounds to fear that they may produce imperfect offspring may be prevented from contracting a marriage that could be fertile, even if they are otherwise capable of marriage, and they may be sterilized, even against their will. Children conceived by parents of this kind may be removed by the direct intervention of an abortion. </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Or:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> The first and chief right to educate belongs to that institution which has the first and chief right to provide for the race, i.e.: the state, neither to the Church nor the parents... <p></p> <p></p> <p>As to the education of young people, they should not, in first place, be imbued with religious sentiments or with love and fear of God but with a feeling of affection for the race so that they regard nothing on this earth with more respect than the race and the state built on the basis of racial character.</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Or:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> Nothing but the absolute and unlimited leadership of one man is the form of government in the state that is in keeping with the lawful path which nature follows in selecting races and individuals. <p></p> <p></p> <p>Any other form of government is more or less a contravention of nature.</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Or:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> Single individuals and associations of people have no rights, either by divine or natural law, which are prior to the state or independent of it and not only is the exercise of rights decided upon by the state but even their origin and simple existence. </blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The program of National Socialism and its practice were being branded as incompatible with Christianity years before Pius XII mounted the throne of St. Peter in 1939. His predecessor Pius XI (1922-39) and other leading figures in the curial establishment believed that such statements would be interpreted, in Germany, as a declaration of spiritual war.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The story of how and why the Catholic Church planned to condemn the Nazis, and of what became of those plans, sheds new light on the inner workings of the Vatican on the eve of the Second World War. The sources, previously inaccessible, enable us to penetrate behind the scenes and understand the ways in which, after the Nazis came to power, Rome thought and operated.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The operations of the Roman authorities -- not always a model of efficiency -- were conducted through an ill-coordinated bureaucracy that followed procedures which had developed over centuries. Attentive to precedents set in the past, members of the Curia knew that history provided them with several possible forms of condemnation, at various levels of solemnity.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The forms in which Rome's statements were made, and the contexts in which they appeared, could convey messages subtler and more precise than the public declarations of a secular state. There was a significant difference, for example, between a papal pronouncement of disapproval reported in the Vatican's semiofficial newspaper, <i>Osservatore Romano</i>, and an anathema leveled by the Pope as head of the Church's Supreme Tribunal. The first resembled a rumble of thunder, menacing but remote. The second was similar to a bolt of lightning, aimed to strike at an error, root and branch.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A decree from the Supreme Tribunal, signed by the Pope, had binding force on Catholics in matters of doctrine and morals. In these matters of fundamental importance, the judgment of the Supreme Pontiff was definitive. When he condemned an error with the weight of his unerring authority, it was announced by that papal tribunal known, since the sixteenth century, as the Roman Inquisition or Holy Office. One of its severest sentences, delivered as punishment, was excommunication -- exclusion from the community of the faithful, to which Adolf Hitler nominally belonged.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Less punitive in effect and more positive in purpose were the encyclicals, or papal letters, which expressed the <i>magisterium</i> ("teaching") of the Pope. Issued in his name, often on the basis of contributions made by members of the Vatican's bureaucracy, such documents represented declarations of principle by the head of the Roman Church. Beneath these two peaks of solemnity -- the encyclical and the inquisitorial decree -- lower levels of publicity could also signal the Vatican's view.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Works might be placed on the Index of Prohibited Books, indicating that they were banned for Catholics; diplomatic notes of protest or clarification might be exchanged with foreign governments; instructions might be imparted to orthodox institutions of learning, ordering them to contest suspect ideas. During the 1930s, all of these possibilities were considered or implemented by Rome. When and why they were employed or discarded, and by whom, were questions that engaged Hitler's attention.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The F�hrer was sensitive to the nuances of the Vatican's official voice. Ambiguous in his alternations between respect and loathing for the Church, he hesitated to repudiate Christianity. Its language, its categories, its images loom large in <i>Mein Kampf</i> and in his later writings and speeches. Divine providence, Hitler claimed, guided National Socialism in its struggle for "racial purity." Jesus Christ, for him, was not only "the true God" but also "our greatest Aryan leader." The next figure in the F�hrer's pantheon appears to have been himself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Like Mussolini, he saw himself as a redeemer. Unlike the Duce, Hitler claimed that his movement had discovered the true meaning of the New Testament. The Old Testament was excluded because it was "Semitic"; God's law was to be identified with racism. Hitler portrayed himself as the prophet of this doctrine, which the Catholic Church had perverted; and the "positive Christianity" to which the program of the Nazi Party referred was meant to heal the confessional divisions between German Catholics and Protestants, and to unite the nation in its fight against the Jews.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The Jews and the "Bolsheviks" played leading parts in Hitler's melodrama of hatred, and he dressed them in demonic costumes. Yet the confusion of roles produced by his misuse of religious language never led the F�hrer to forget that, on the world stage that he desired to dominate, the Vatican still occupied some of the limelight.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>There opinions were divided from the beginning. Some in the Vatican saw Hitler as a perfidious enemy of Christianity, others as a Catholic conservative who might be taken at his word. That the F&#x19;...</p>While he purports to defend the Vatican against "polemics" and "moralists," Godman's account of the Vatican's failure to oppose Hitler, based on recently released documents, is in some ways as damning as Goldhagen's A Moral Reckoning. He focuses on the 1930s and two men, Pope Pius XI and his secretary of state, Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. Neither man comes off well, bound as they were by legalisms, propriety and an almost obsessive desire to maintain the facade of reciprocity embodied in the Vatican's Concordat with Nazi Germany. Both fully recognized that Nazism was incompatible with Christian doctrine, and therein lies the real tragedy of Godman's well-told tale. While Godman, a Vatican scholar and member of the Church's Committee for the Archives of the Holy Office, paints portraits of two tormented but indecisive men, other culprits are the ineffective papal delegate in Berlin, Cardinal Orsenigo, and the Austrian bishop Alois Hudal. This is also a study of the structural and institutional inertia of the Vatican. Caught between the dual threats of Nazism and Bolshevism, popes, German bishops and Vatican authorities failed to articulate a single, coherent, theologically sound and politically savvy condemnation of National Socialism. Like Pius XI's "hidden encyclical" denouncing racism, two highly specific condemnations of Nazism, drafted in 1935 and 1936, were never promulgated for diplomatic and political reasons. One can only read these documents (included as appendixes I and II) with a heartrending sense of what might have been. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the hands of Jean de Meun, who continued de Lorris's work, it assumed vast proportions and embraced almost every aspect of medieval life from predestination and optics, to the Franciscan controversy and the right way to deal with premature hair-loss.</p><p>Many English-speaking readers of the Roman de la rose, the famous dream allegory of the thirteenth century, have come to rely on Charles Dahlberg&#39;s elegant and precise translation of the Old French text. His line-by-line rendering in contemporary English is available again, this time in a third edition with an updated critical apparatus. Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest - against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance - to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden. The original introduction by Dahlberg remains an excellent overview of the work, covering such topics as the iconographic significance of the imagery and the use of irony in developing the central theme of love. His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990 and beyond, which examines, for example, the sources and influences, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem&#39;s early reception. The new bibliographic material incorporates that of the earlier editions.

But he was also a groundbreaking poet and an iconoclastic visionary whose literary and cultural legacies extend far beyond the limits of his reputation. This controversial individual, a frightening mixture of egomania and self-loathing, has inspired passionate--but seldom fair--assesments by historians. Sutin, by treating Crowley as a cultural phenomenon, and not simply a sorcerer or a charlatan, convinces skeptic readers that the self-styled "Beast" remains a fascinating study in eccentricity.</p></p><p>The legendary Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) is a tantalizing and bizarre subject. As an occult leader, heroin addict, sexual adventurer, misogynist, and visionary, he is the inspiration for many vile Gothic protagonists. Author W. Somerset Maugham even devoted a novel, <i>The Magician</i>, to this chilling figure of indulgence and religious mockery. Like any good biographer, Lawrence Sutin set out to discover the man behind the myth. After considerable research, Sutin admits that Crowley was "a shameless scoffer at Christian virtue" and "a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family," but he also sees him as a 20th century figure as "protean, brilliant, courageous, and flabbergasting as ever you could imagine."<p> Consider these facts about the man who named himself "The Great Beast": He was one of the first Westerners to seriously study Buddhism and Yoga. He radically redesigned the traditional Tarot deck (thus the "Crowley deck"). Contrary to common belief, he was never known to participate in satanic ritual--to do so would acknowledge the Christian church, which he was loathe to do (although he nicknamed his son "The Christ Child"). These are but a few of the surprising morsels one can glean from this excellent biography. Don't expect to find Crowley a likable figure.

He lives in New York City.The selections in this ill-digested compendium are a haphazardly mixed bag. Ben Franklin is showcased with worldly aphorisms and his arguments, some tongue in cheek, for the turkey and rattlesnake as national symbols. John Adams mutters some dyspeptic aphorisms. George Washington dispenses stolid endorsements of virtue and religion, including not one but two long-winded Thanksgiving proclamations. Nearly half the book is given over to Jefferson's musings on the wisdom of the people and the evils of unfettered government, while Madison weighs in on the madness of the people and Hamilton extols the benefits of unfettered government. Enlightenment firebrand Tom Paine imprecates organized religion, and the randomly included Benjamin Rush offers a dubious prescription of bleeding and purging as a cure for yellow fever. Careful readers can discern the currents of political thought in the early Republic through this hodge-podge, but they will get little help from the slipshod editing. The contents are only sporadically organized by theme, and not at all by date. Most passages have no citations to guide readers to sources. There are few notes, so puzzling references go unexplained, and some of the selections are repeated, sometimes on the very same page. The sections on Madison and Hamilton seem to have been indiscriminately xeroxed from the Federalist Papers and include stray truisms like Hamilton's reminder, apropos of nothing, that "In disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary truths, or first principles, upon which all subsequent reasoning must depend." Readers in search of wit and wisdom will have to wade through a lot of banality and boilerplate first. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Between the East and West: Across The Borderlands Of Europe</h2><p>A vivid and human glimpse into Europe&#39;s borderlands as they emerged from Soviet rule - back in print after nearly 20 years &#39;In this superb book, in which one senses the spirit of Franz Kafka and Bruno Schulz, the dramatic world of the Eastern borderlands comes to life&#39; Ryszard Kapuscinski As Europe&#39;s borderlands emerged from Soviet rule, Anne Applebaum travelled from the Baltic to the Black Sea, through Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and the Carpathian mountains.

She is Professor of Practice at the Institute for Global Affairs, London School of Economics, and a columnist for the Washington Post. She divides her time between Britain and Poland.A journey through middle Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, of which George Orwell would have been proud, if he had extended his own travels from the Road to Wigan Pier to Minsk. This is not a land flowing with milk and honey. The region and its peoples have been fought over, uprooted, persecuted, and killed for a thousand years. Just in this century, the Borderlands have survived the collapse of three empires, the division of the spoils after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, the Second World War, the Holocaust, Stalin's despotism, and the fall of the Soviet Union. As Applebaum, foreign editor for the London Spectator, aptly comments, ``To sift through the layers, one needs to practice a kind of visual and aural archeology.'' She does so with sensitive skill, noting how the cobblestones have disappeared beneath cracked concrete, how medieval foundations have vanished behind ``spectacular monotony,'' and how churches and shops have given way to numbered apartment blocks. She records the rival nationalisms- -Lithuanians hating Poles, Poles hating Lithuanians, everyone hating the Russians. She sees the miles of rusting Soviet naval ships in Kaliningrad, the pit behind the courthouse in Woroniaki in the Ukraine where the KGB dumped the bodies of those they had executed, and records the changes that have taken place as a Ukrainian professor of atheism renames himself professor of religion but delivers the same lectures. She ends her visit in Odessa, with its elegant houses, the only upbeat part of the trip. Otherwise, one is inclined to agree with the Russian who observes sourly that there is no difference between a peasant on the Volga and a man living in the African jungle except that the African has sunlight, fresh air, clean water, and no ice in the winter. The decor may be Soviet drab and mildew, but the book is intelligent, evocative, filled with vivid characterization and an understanding of the history of the area. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Russ Manning, famous for his spectacular work on the Tarzan newspaper strips of the late sixties, brought fans his &#34;Tarzan of the future&#34; in Magnus, Robot Fighter. While his work on the original comic series lasted only twenty-one issues, Manning&#39;s creation has survived generations, influencing countless science fiction artists and writers to this day. Fans of Alex Raymond, Mac Raboy, or Wally Wood should not miss this beautifully bound hardcover - the third Magnus archival collection and the latest addition to Dark Horse&#39;s line of science fiction classics.</p><p><b>Russ Manning </b>(1929&#x2013;1981) was a comic book artist who is currently a member of the Comic Book Hall of Fame. Manning is known for <i>Magnus, Robot Fighter&nbsp;</i>and <i>Tarzan. </i>He was educated at the Los Angeles County Art Institute and soon after graduating began working at Dell Comics. Manning's work in newspaper comic strips is considered legendary and the Russ Manning Award, an award given to the most promising newcomer in the field of comic book illustration, is named after him.The last of three volumes collecting artist Manning's mid-1960s stint on <i>agnus, Robot Fighter</i> contains the story many fans remember as the series' high point, "Cloud-Cloddie, Go Home," in which Magnus, who uses martial-arts skills to protect the world of 4000 A.D. from renegade robots and traitorous humans, learns of the impoverished underclass living on the lowest levels of the glittering continent-wide city, NorthAm. Again, this collection suffers from substandard reproduction that drops out much of Manning's crisp line work. What remains, however, is sufficient to affirm that <i>Magnus </i>was one of its era's most gorgeously illustrated comics. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Years later, the brothers&#x2019; bond remains so strong that it transcends the normal boundaries separating life and death. Charlie St. Cloud lives in a snug New England fishing village. By day he tends the lawns and monuments of the ancient cemetery where his younger brother, Sam, is buried. Graced with an extraordinary gift after surviving the accident, he can still see, talk, and even play catch with Sam&#x2019;s spirit. But townsfolk whisper that Charlie has never recovered from his loss.<br><br>Into his carefully ordered life comes Tess Carroll, a captivating, adventuresome woman training for a solo sailing trip around the globe. Fate steers her boat into a treacherous storm that blows her back to harbor, to a charged encounter with Charlie, and to a surprise more overwhelming than the violent sea itself. Charlie and Tess discover a beautiful and uncommon connection that leads to a race against time and a desperate choice between death and life, between the past and the future, between holding on and letting go.<br><br>Luminous, soulful, and filled with unforgettable characters, <i>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud</i> is one of those rare, wise books that reveal the mysteries of the unseen world around us, gently transforming the worst pain of loss into hope, healing, and even laughter. Suspenseful and deeply moving, its startling climax reminds us that sometimes tragedies can bring about miracles if we simply open our hearts.</p><p><strong>Questions for Ben Sherwood About <em>Charlie St. Cloud</em></strong> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you always imagine your book becoming a movie? <br> <b>A:</b> In a word...no. I quit a great job at NBC News in New York to write this book. It was a risky career move. I wish I could say the road was easy, but it wasn&#x2019;t. There were major creative challenges and serious professional setbacks. Indeed, the route from blank page to the finished book might well be described as a near-death publishing experience. Perhaps that&#x2019;s why I never really imagined this book becoming a movie. Indeed, the very idea of a film adaptation seemed farfetched. As one of my close friends always said: "I&#x2019;ll believe <em>Charlie St. Cloud</em> is a movie when I&#x2019;m sitting in the theater and eating popcorn."</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How involved were you with the movie and did you write the screenplay?<br> <b>A:</b> The producers and studio were generous to include me at many stages of the process but I wasn&#x2019;t involved with the movie or screenplay. I was fortunate to visit the production twice, once on location in a cemetery and another time on a soundstage in Vancouver. Each time, I relished how filmmakers turned some of the book&#x2019;s tiniest details into movie reality. For instance, Major League Baseball sent three small Red Sox mitts for Sam to use when he played catch with Charlie. I watched an assistant prop master carry a brand-new red mitt around all day, rubbing it constantly to give it a well-worn appearance.<br> <br> On another occasion, the director showed me the closing shot of the film. Today, words still fail to describe the exhilarating experience of seeing Charlie and Tess literally sailing into the sunset. Seven years earlier, in the quiet of my little writing room, I had imagined these two young people on a boat aimed at the open ocean. Suddenly, they were on the screen, leaning into each other with wind tousling their hair and sails, steering a Gryphon Solo, one of the world&#x2019;s fastest fifty-foot sailboats, filmed by a camera mounted on a helicopter hovering above.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How does it feel to see your book turned into a movie?<br> <b>A:</b> Quite simply, I&#x2019;m filled with gratitude. To create the movie version of <em>Charlie St. Cloud</em>, it took 28 actors, 34 stunt people, and some 250 crew. When I visited the set in Vancouver, I tried my best to thank every single one, including the wrangler responsible for a noisy flock of geese, the messy bane of Charlie&#x2019;s existence.<br><br> When I called my wife in Los Angeles, she asked, "How does it feel?" I thought for a moment. Then I answered: "I want to hug every person I meet."</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you imagine Zac Efron as Charlie St. Cloud?<br> <b>A:</b> In candor, I never imagined Zac Efron in the role of Charlie. Wrecked by loss and grief, Charlie was a character who had wasted many years of his precious life. I always imagined Charlie as much older and much sadder. Thank goodness I&#x2019;m not a movie producer. <br> <br> I salute the studio and producers for realizing that Efron was a perfect choice. Young, dynamic, and charismatic, he embodies the promise of Charlie St. Cloud without the burden and loss. With Efron&#x2019;s vibrant presence and performance, a sometimes weighty story feels more hopeful and uplifting. As I told Efron when we met in the cemetery in Vancouver, I&#x2019;m delighted and very thankful that he took the part and filled it with vitality. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> How do you feel about the movie being made in Vancouver, Canada instead of Marblehead, Massachussetts, where the novel takes place? <br> <b>A:</b> I love Marblehead and the people of the town. While researching the book, I traveled to Marblehead several times to walk among the tombstones in Waterside Cemetery, eat breakfast with fishermen at the Driftwood before dawn, drink beers with 'Headers at Maddie's, and compete in my first and only sailboat race.<br> <br> Vancouver is a country away from the wonderful town where I situated the story. But a movie adaptation isn't supposed to be a literal translation of a book. It's an interpretation. While I sincerely hoped that the film would be made in Massachusetts--and while the filmmakers tried their best too--I understood the financial decision to pick Canada, where production costs are significantly lower.<br> <br> Given this choice, the filmmakers did a great job transplanting Charlie and Sam's story to the Pacific Northwest, which looks absolutely spectacular on film.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your writing seems to focus on questions of life and death. Why?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe it's my age or life experience but I've spent a lot of time thinking about how we overcome grief and loss and make the most of our time on earth. These are subjects that have come to occupy my recent work. Over the last few years, I wrote a nonfiction book called <em>The Survivors Club</em>, exploring the secrets and science of the world&#x2019;s most effective survivors and thrivers. Interviewing survivors around the world, I discovered even more proof that love is a powerful and universal survival tool. In my own life, falling in love with my future wife, Karen, helped unlock the stranglehold of my father&#x2019;s sudden and untimely death 17 years ago. (That&#x2019;s why I dedicated the book to both of them.) In Charlie's case, discovering Tess helped him break free of the cemetery and the suffocating grip of grief.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You have two young sons. What do you hope they take away from this book some day?<br> <b>A:</b> When I was leaving the movie set in Vancouver to fly home to Los Angeles, one of the producers generously asked if I wanted a souvenir from the production. I asked for one of Sam&#x2019;s red mitts from Major League Baseball. Our two young boys can play catch with it. Then some day when they outgrow it, the glove can sit in my office, a reminder of the power of brotherly love and what happens when you take risks, seize life, and set your imagination free.</p> <br>&#x201c;Ben Sherwood is an amazing writer with the rare gift of evoking genuine emotion. <b>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud</b> is touching, wise, and full of hope, everything a wonderful novel should be.

Ideas that would ground McLuhan's media analysis of the 1960s and 70s are here in embryo, as he sets out in scrupulous detail the role of grammar (interpretation), dialectic, and rhetoric in classical learning.<br><br> Under McLuhan's scholarly microscope, the internal dynamics of the trivium and its purpose are revealed. As is its indispensable role in giving full due to the rich prose of Thomas Nashe. In ranging over literature from Cicero to the sixteenth century, McLuhan discovers the source and significance of multiple traditions in Nashe's writings. Here, more than half a century after it was written, is a fresh, insightful, and richly coherent framework for studying Nashe and an unequivocal call for a program of education based on the ambitious and lofty ideal of reintegrating the classical trivium.</p><p>Marshall McLuhan (1911 - 1980) was honoured for his achievemnets by institutions and governments across Europe and North America. His books have been published in more than a dozen languages and continue to sell throughout the world.<br></p><h2>Algebra 1: Concepts and Skills- Practice Workbook with Examples, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Has answer key in back of book</p><p></p><h2>More From Less: How we Finally Stopped Using Up The World - And What Happens Next</h2><p><b>Bestselling author and co-director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy Andrew McAfee says there&#x2019;s a new reason for optimism: we&#x2019;re past the point of 'peak stuff' - from here on out, it&#x2019;ll take fewer resources to make things, and cost less to lead a comfortable life.</b><br><br> This turn of events invalidates the predictions of overpopulation alarmists and those who argue we need to drastically reduce our conception of how much is enough. What has made this turnabout possible? One thing primarily: <b>the collaboration between technology and capitalism.</b><br><br> Capitalism&#x2019;s quest for higher profits is a quest for lower costs; materials and resources are expensive, and technological progress allows companies to use fewer of them even as they grow their markets. Modern smartphones take the place of cameras, GPS units, landline telephones, answering machines, tape recorders and alarm clocks. Precision agriculture lets farmers harvest larger crops while using less water and fertiliser. Passenger cars get lighter, which makes them cheaper to produce and more fuel-efficient. This means that, <b>even though there&#x2019;ll be more people in the future, and they&#x2019;ll be wealthier and consume more, they&#x2019;ll do so while using fewer natural resources</b>. For the first time ever, and for all time to come, humans will live more prosperous lives while treading more lightly on the Earth.<br><br> The future is not <i>all </i>bright, cautions McAfee. He warns of issues that still haven&#x2019;t been fully solved. (For example, our oceans are still vulnerable to overfishing; global warming is still running largely unchecked; and even as 'dematerialisation' - the reduced need for raw materials - improves our global situation, power and resources are getting more concentrated. That creates an even larger division between the haves and the have nots.)<br><br><b><i>Post-Peak</i> is a revelatory, paradigm-shifting account of how we&#x2019;ve stumbled into an unexpected balance with nature, and the possibility that our most abundant centuries are ahead of us.</b></p><p></p><h2>A Apple Pie and Traditional Nursery Rhymes (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>This charming volume brings back into print some of the finest illustrated children's books from the Arts and Crafts Movement: Kate Greenaway's much-loved alphabet book, <b>A Apple Pie</b><i>,</i> along with a selection of her illustrated nursery rhymes.Greenaway's drawings conjure up a never-never land of rural simplicity and innocence&#x2013;an escape from the squalor of Victorian cities&#x2013;that is as delightful now as it was when these gems of children's literature first appeared in the 1880s.</p><p><b>Kate Greenaway</b> (1846&#x2014;1901) was an English illustrator and watercolorist famous for her fanciful, humorous drawings of child life.</p><h2>Moonlight in the Morning (New York Times Bestselling Author)</h2><p>Readers will blaze through Deveraux's latest contemporary romance set in Edilean, Va.

They span the years from 1915 till a few days before her death in 1941. She describes with perception and lively wit public events, gossip about her famous circle of friends and the difficulties she endured with her art.</p><p>VIRGINIA WOOLF (1882&#x2013;1941) was&nbsp;one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.Woolf's diaries of 1915-1941, abridged to a fifth of their original published size, include portraits of T. S. Eliot and Katherine Mansfield; comments on sales and reviews of her books; pleasant musings and acerbic remarks. According to PW , ``The diaries here may appeal to a larger audience, not least because each year represented is prefaced by a wonderfully succinct overview.'' (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>A tastefully abridged edition of the five volumes of Woolf's Diary (1977-1984). Featuring a new introduction by Woolf's nephew Quentin Bell, and edited by Quentin's wife, Anne, who edited the five-volume set, the abridgement provides an intimate record of Woolf's life from 1915 to 1941. The earliest entries focus mostly on social and domestic matters (1915: "Sunday 31 January: O dear!

Like no other books about the war, Wouk&#x2019;s spellbinding narrative captures the tide of global events &#x2014; and all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of World War II &#x2014; as it immerses us in the lives of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war&#x2019;s maelstrom. &#x201c;The Winds of War gives more vivid pictures of the principal leaders of the war than military and political history could.

Poppy Jenkins makes everyone smile. She&#x2019;s the heart of Wells, a beautiful village in mid-Wales, leaving light and laughter in her wake. She has a doting family, an errant dog and a little sister with a nose for mischief. But she&#x2019;s the only gay in the village and it&#x2019;s a long time since she kissed a girl: the chance of romance in sleepy Wells is rarer than a barking sheep. If she doesn&#x2019;t think too hard, life is cosy, until a smart sports car barrels into town with the last woman Poppy wants to see behind the wheel. Beautiful Rosalyn Thorn was once Poppy&#x2019;s high school BFF even though she was trouble. Then one day she abandoned Wells and Poppy without explanation. Now the highflier is back and bound to cause fresh havoc in the village and with Poppy&#x2019;s heart; folk are not happy.

Pope falsified his age in order to enlist in the British Merchant Navy during World War II. In action, his ship was torpedoed and he spent 14 days at sea in an open lifeboat. After being discharged due to the injuries he received, he worked as the naval and defense correspondent at the London Daily News. He turned to writing fiction at the urging of C. S. Forester, who viewed Pope as his creative heir. Author of ten non-fiction historical works as well as the 18 books in the Ramage series, Dudley Pope died in 1997.Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope was born in 1925 into an ancient Cornish seafaring family. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and his resulting spinal injuries plagues him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war he turned to journalism becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the London Evening News. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965 he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic Lord Nicholas Ramage during the Napoleonic Wars. He continued to live aboard boats whenever possible and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels.

The first of these was the Debutante Dress that Jerilyn would wear when she would take her father&#x2019;s arm and march across the stage in Raleigh, into the single spotlight, radiant, along with all the other debs in North Carolina.</p> <p>As of last week, the suspense concerning that dress had been extinguished, when Jerilyn and her pals from Mecklenburg Country Day, Bethany and Mallory, besieged uptown formal shops to hunt down their quarry, capturing and releasing, debating, embracing, denouncing many white gowns before claiming the perfectly flattering one as their own. Jerilyn suffered an hour of agony as she prayed that her more assertive friends would not fall in love with the beautiful number on the mannequin near the cashier&#x2019;s station as she had. The crinkled taffeta, treated with some French-termed process, so smooth, like petting a puppy, had an internal corset, mermaid tail, subtle beading that sparkled opalescent around the slimming bodice, all blooming out upon layer upon layer of tulle, soft and dreamy. Wearing it would defy gravity; to walk into the light would be like floating in on a tulle cloud, something right out of an antebellum cotillion, which would please her father. He did his best to remain in that world before 1860: Duke Johnston, descendant of Civil War General Joseph E. Johnston.</p> <p>Even though the debut was a year off, she had an impulse to take the gown with her to university, let it hang in her Chapel Hill closet so she might look in on it, stroke and adore it, have it as a beacon before her. But the gown was so wide at the bottom, and surely dorm room closets were tiny and who knows what could happen to it there, when it would be safe and sound right here at home.</p> <p>The second white gown, the Bridal Gown, was thought of solemnly; it would involve years of decision-making. It was, really, a life&#x2019;s work. Jerilyn and her female contemporaries, having just graduated high school, had already put in reverent hours with scores of bridal magazines, begun the opinionated window-shopping, attended the society weddings like dress rehearsals for one&#x2019;s own event, notes mentally taken, good things memorized so they might be borrowed or varied, atrocities eschewed. The decision about that gown, mercifully, could wait some years hence.</p> <p>When she&#x2019;d brought up the issue of a showstopper wedding dress with her mother, she was cautioned to whoa the horses. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do something, I would hope, with your future Carolina degree,&#x201d; her mother reasoned. &#x201c;Enjoy your independence. Work for a few years before you see which of the young men you met at Carolina seems destined for something besides his parents&#x2019; basement. Or, given the atmosphere at Carolina, rehab.&#x201d;</p> <p>Even though Jerilyn&#x2019;s mother was her hero&#x2014;Jerene Jarvis Johnston, director of the Jarvis Trust for American Art at the Mint Museum, respected matriarch of one of Charlotte&#x2019;s first families&#x2014;and her mother was almost, almost her best friend&nbsp;&#x2026; her mother did not understand everything. Jerilyn would be very happy to find a husband quickly at Carolina and begin fomenting wedding plans no later than her senior year. She did not yearn to be part of a workplace, never failing to be somewhere for a set time in the morning, nor did she care to learn what it was to balance checkbooks and be frugal; she felt her life would be quite fine without those improving, self-revealing years of sacrifice starting at the bottom rung of something. She wanted (1) to be married in four years, (2) move soon into a beautiful home, (3) babies soon after. She longed to decorate her own new house, having her father and mother&#x2014;who was an accomplished hostess without compare&#x2014;over to their new home to see what she, Jerilyn, could offer as hospitality, how she could arrange a centerpiece and the Proven�al floral tablecloth with the majolica place settings from Umbria she coveted at Nordstrom. See, Mom, how the tiger lily is picked up in the fleur-de-lys along the golden trim of the dinner plate and the scarlet mandala pattern on the Kashmiri linen napkins (on sale last week at Belk)?</p> <p>And this desire led to Jerilyn&#x2019;s one upcoming act of proposed rebellion. She was going to rush a sorority. She had visited older friends at Carolina, girls content with life in the dormitory, study breaks at ten P.M., girls in sweatshirts gossiping and squealing in the hallways with bowls of microwaved popcorn, pop music blasting. Seemed nice. But it wouldn&#x2019;t get her where she wanted to go: before the eligible men of North Carolina, the next generation of doctors and lawyers and tycoons. Mother had forbidden sororities, because of expense and distraction, and provided lectures on how very different they had become &#x201c;since her day.&#x201d; On some mornings, Jerilyn hoped that she might persuade her mother otherwise.</p> <p>No, she quickly told herself on this particular morning&#x2014;Jerilyn, get real. She would not change her mother&#x2019;s mind. Mrs. Johnston had never, since birth, changed her mind about anything. It had to be presented to her mother as a fait accompli. Even then, Jerilyn reflected in these last minutes in her childhood bedroom, her mother could scotch the whole enterprise, such were her powers&#x2019; vast and immeasurable sweep. She&#x2019;d probably call the chancellor or something, get the sorority disbanded nationally&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Jerilyn stood looking at the Debutante Dress hanging in her bedroom closet, along with the unwanted clothes not making the journey to Chapel Hill. She had packed three suitcases of clothes and another three boxes of accessories, the heaviest being her curling irons and blow-dryers and expensive hair care products. &#x201c;You can open your own salon, sweetheart,&#x201d; her father said, as he packed the car. There was another suitcase&#x2014;well, a small trunk&#x2014;just for shoes, then her computer and stacks of school supplies&nbsp;&#x2026; the BMW was full to the brim. No, the dress would not be going. She touched it a final time and respectfully shut the closet door.</p> <p>She should feel more wistful and sad, shouldn&#x2019;t she? Here it was at long last, farewell to her childhood room, bye-bye to the stuffed animals (well, the pink panda Skip Baylor gave her for her birthday was headed to Chapel Hill, after all), bye-bye to the Justin Timberlake poster inside the closet door, her faded valentine and birthday cards taped to the vanity mirror, remnants of proms and parties, all of it girly and vaguely embarrassing. Nope, no sadness at all. She had waited and waited for this day&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to Carolina and begin her life. She was the last of the four children, the &#x201c;accident,&#x201d; no matter how they euphemized about it, a full ten years out from the other three, Bo, Annie, and Joshua. Her siblings doted on her, patted her head, thought she was a little pest or brat or doll, some entity at whom love could be directed but not quite fully human. She used to hate being the outlier youngest, but she reconciled to it. It meant being the baby, being spoiled a little.</p> <p>She checked the vanity mirror one more time. Her stylist had convinced Jerilyn to cut her hair short in a nice rounded bob. Everyone loved it; they loved it so openly and insistently that she realized she must have looked quite dreadful beforehand with dull brown hair to her shoulders that never kept a shape, that fanned out and frizzed. She could grow it long but it was never shampoo-commercial long, gleaming silken tresses that coiled and released, forming waves of sheen. If she lolled her head like a model in a L&#x2019;Or�al commercial, the hair moved in a piece&#x2014;it was never silken tresses, it was shrubbery. So Jerilyn had given up that fond fantasy of luxurious hair, as well as a notion that she was a certain kind of beautiful. With the bob she was cute, not beautiful. Mind you, she could work with cute. Big eyes looking out from under bangs, very winning with a subtle suggestive smile, a natural shyness she intended to kill off as soon as she got to Chapel Hill, starting later this very day when her father would charmingly stall for time making small talk with her new roommate, launching into perfectly interesting but wholly irrelevant ruminations on North Carolina history, before kissing his little princess goodbye and driving back to Charlotte.</p> <p>&#x201c;Alma?&#x201d; Jerilyn left her bedroom and called out from the upper-floor staircase. Their housekeeper was nowhere to be found. It would have been a special goodbye had Alma been there to receive it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; she called out. He wasn&#x2019;t back yet. He said he would take the BMW out to fill the gas tank for the two-hour journey ahead.</p> <p>Mom wasn&#x2019;t fooling anybody. After breakfast she invented some small crisis at the museum, the site of her upcoming fund-raiser. She hugged Jerilyn briefly and said they would talk this evening. Mom didn&#x2019;t do mush. Jerilyn knew that her mother was privately distressed to be losing the last of the four children; the nest was looking a little too empty that morning, so off she went to yell at the caterers. Jerilyn didn&#x2019;t mind. She admired her mother&#x2019;s complete lack of public sentimentality&#x2014;she hoped to emulate it, one of these days.</p> <p>So, she had the house to herself.</p> <p>Jerilyn walked down the foyer steps of the two-story entrance hall, the grandest room in the house which, given her imminent departure, suddenly struck her as a feature she might well miss. The Johnston house dated from 1890, built by her great-grandfather (also Joseph Beauregard Johnston, like her father). It sat regally high on its hill on Providence Road for all to see, at the very entrance to the Myers Park neighborhood, the most monied enclave of Charlotte, North Carolina. Jerilyn had been told that the house used to be surrounded by acres of land that they had once owned but, through the decades, the property had been divided and sold for infusions of cash.</p> <p>Given the neighboring piles of tacky turrets and mansard roofs, faux-antebellum columns and sentry gates bearing coats of arms, the Johnston compound appeared modest. It was part of the architect&#x2019;s genius&#x2014;it advertised to the world an unassuming, comfortable two-story home from the outside, but it was spacious as any rambling mansion inside. Cushioned by ancient oak trees, the house sat back contentedly, hiding even its best feature, a large columned side porch, and its second best, a brick verandah and a perfectly enclosed backyard with its whisperings of a country estate: a small birdbath fountain that had not burbled since her childhood, a rose garden which needed much tending, and an arbor and trellis which needed none at all, dependably covered in wisteria or morning glories no matter the neglect. The upstairs of the house contained the six bedrooms. The downstairs had been featured once in <i>Southern Living</i> magazine: the long elegant dining room with the imitation Adam plasterwork on the ceiling, a kitchen large enough to provide hospitality to parties of a hundred or more, several beautifully realized sitting rooms&#x2014;a classic American room, perfect for one of her mother&#x2019;s high teas; a blue French sitting room for solitude on gray afternoons, for reading and not being disturbed, avoided inexplicably by every male in the family; an off-to-the-side warren of parquet floors and custom cherrywood cabinetry that picked up a Frank Lloyd Wright flavor for the TV room and entertainment center.</p> <p>The main attraction, of course, was her father&#x2019;s Civil War Study, which might have been directly swiped from the mid-nineteenth century. You had to take a small step down in order to enter it; Jerilyn imagined this small difference of elevation to be part of the magic spell that allowed you to leave the publicity and bustle of the rest of the house for the rarefied sense of the past. Like a carnival barker, Jerilyn had offered peeks to the neighborhood children, sometimes sneaking in illegally with her schoolmates&#x2014;invariably boys&#x2014;who would beg to take a closer look at the swords, dueling pistols, old maps of battle plans, engravings and parchments of the period, a cannonball. Every book on the Study&#x2019;s shelves was a first edition from the Civil War era (Dad kept his more modern history books upstairs in the bedroom). Prohibitions against entering, let alone touching anything, haunted all secret reconnaissance missions&#x2014;and Alma, if she saw any signs of trespass, would tattle on her or any of her siblings, so all forays had to be timed for when Alma was out in the laundry room attached to the garage. Jerilyn loved to have an excuse to visit her father there amid the smell of pipe smoke, burnished leather, book mold, and the aromatic hickory wood in the fireplace; it smelled of an ever-welcoming past, of lost causes and unvanquished honor.</p> <p>She heard her father&#x2019;s car in the driveway. So now it really was goodbye to the house. What do you know, she sniffed: one tear, after all.</p> <p>NOTHING COULD BE FINER</p> <p>By Joshua Johnston</p> <p>Your best introduction to Chapel Hill would be to make your way to the hill where the chapel used to be. Saunter into the Carolina Inn for a proper mint julep by the fireplace in the Crossroads Bar before going into the big overdone dining room. It looks like half a dozen plantation drawing rooms exploded in there. Chow down on an eight-course creole-Piedmont gastric blowout, before stumbling to the nearby corner of Franklin and Columbia Streets with all the bars. Try negotiating the balcony at Top of the Hill when Carolina beats Duke in basketball some Saturday night. The scene rivals something out of Ancient Rome, except with lots more vomiting.</p> <p>This is, indeed, the top of the hill that had the chapel. Even before the university was established, in 1790, as the first state-funded university of the United States,1 locals had already given up on the local church. So it was knocked down so taverns and public houses could take their rightful place. We have our priorities here.</p> <p>In 1980, <i>Playboy</i> magazine determined that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill led the nation in student alcoholism, followed by Ohio State and Alabama.2 This was based on the high freshman-year flunk-out rate for which drink was to blame</p> <p>Jerilyn stopped reading there and nervously began twisting her hair. She reached for her cell phone to call her brother.</p> <p>&#x201c;Josh. Thanks for the essay, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But nothing you can use? I mean, I wrote it when I was a senior but I don&#x2019;t think UNC has changed that much.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jerilyn didn&#x2019;t want to sound ungrateful. &#x201c;Who let you write a paper like this? It&#x2019;s so opinionated.&#x201d;</p> <p>In Jerilyn&#x2019;s ENG 101 Rhet-Comp class all the students picked names of North Carolina towns out of a hat. She got Chapel Hill. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to write a factual historical paper. I don&#x2019;t think Brandon would want us to write it like this.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You get to call your instructor by his first name? God, Chapel Hill. Whoa, a customer. Looking at the five-hundred-dollar silk ties, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Go make a commission,&#x201d; she directed. Her brother with his two degrees from the University of North Carolina, for years now, working retail in an upscale men&#x2019;s clothing store. Jerilyn was hoping for a better future, but for the moment she was hoping, with the aid of an online encyclopedia, and by semi-plagiarizing her brother&#x2019;s old essay, to knock out her first comp assignment so she could be free and clear of any schoolwork by the weekend. She had to keep that totally open. You never know which of North Carolina&#x2019;s storied sorority houses might summon her to appear.</p> <p>Jerilyn did not want to spend much more time in stately lonely-making McIver Residence Hall. Of course, her randomly assigned roommate, Becca, was really really nice. Jerilyn wondered if she&#x2019;d hurt Becca&#x2019;s feelings when the subject of rushing s...</p></p><h2>Seeker After Truth: A Handbook</h2><p>This collection of tales, discussions, teachings, letters and lectures is a handbook, inviting the reader to re-examine the assumptions of his particular culture; assumptions which are responsible for his conditioning and his outlook on life.

Shah has been described as &#34;the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world.&#34; Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. Shah&#39;s landmark book, &#34;The Sufis&#34;, invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah&#39;s books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography&#39;s Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who&#39;s Who in Poetry&#39;s Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph &#34;it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable&#34;. He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age.ALARM <p>Q: The dangers of personality-worship and the need for everyone to find his own way are the most attractive statements of a certain guru, who has many disciples all over the world. Should he not be listened to? </p><p>A: There is a saying: "Do not fell a tree which is giving shade." Many people imagine that such gurus as this are holy and useful. They are, in fact, providing a distinguished social (though not a spiritual) service. Those who need this "shade" should certainly have it. </p><p>As for others, they should be able to know what is shade and what is something else. </p><p>The way to determine this is to look and see whether, in the words of another proverb, some people are 'Feeding a flame and crying "Fire"!' </p><p>Copyright � 1982, 1992.

In it Richard West vividly portrays the character of the poet, the major stages of his life and the impact of national and international events such as the Hundred Years War, the Protestant Reformation and the overthrow and murder of Richard II. Furnished with Chaucerian and other contemporary sources, the book is aimed at a general audience and is free from the `Chaucerian baggage&#39; that betrays some studies of Chaucer.</p><p>Richard West is a journalist and writer who contributes regularly to The Times Literary Supplement and the Spectator. He has written many books, including a much-admired biography of Daniel Defoe, and is married to the writer Mary Kenny.West's biography of the first great English poet whose name we know quite resembles his <i>Life and Strange, Surprising Adventures of Daniel Defoe</i> (1998). Its overall strategy is to discuss the history surrounding its subject's achievements and those achievements in tandem with tracing the events of his life. It differs markedly, though, from West's account of the first modern English novelist, because, at the distance of 600 years from Chaucer's death, nearly no records exist of any strange, surprising adventures on his part. Undismayed, West raids the historical and critical literature and polishes his own sensible opinions about Chaucer's writings to produce a book every bit as readable and fascinating as his life of Defoe. Individual chapters take up such matters as the Black Death's impact on the anti-Semitism evident in the <i>Prioress's Tale</i> ; why Europe quickly forgot the Black Death; how the thirteenth-century French poem <i>Roman </i> de la Rose and the great Florentine poets Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio influenced Chaucer; the impact of the great English Peasants' Revolt of 1381 on Chaucer's worldview; how <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> anticipates the modern novel; how to read the lengthy <i>Knight's Tale</i> , the boring bane of generations of students, as a satire; and the interpretation of the Wife of Bath as a feminist. A treat for English history and literature buffs who prefer journalistically vital prose to the stodgy varieties usually used to rebury England's liveliest bard. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Foot and J.M. Langley told how captured British servicemen were helped to resist and escape from POW camps. Shoemaker aptly describes America's counterpart effort, MIS-X, to supply prisoners with the means to escape from German POW camps and return home. Nearly all of MIS-X's materials and files were ordered destroyed at war's end. However, Shoemaker is able to tell much of the story from his own work with the group. MIS-X managed to get food, clothes, tools, radios, paper, and printing equipment to prisoners in Europe. Some flyers had learned a code to use in their letters home if captured and were able to provide useful information to U.S. officials. Well written and likely to be enjoyed by layperson or specialist.<br><i>- George H. Siehl, Library of Congress</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.MIS-X was a secret agency of the U.S. WW II War Department assigned to supply "escape aids" to American POWs in Europe. Working with a counterpart British agency, MIS-X also coordinated escape routes. Shoemaker describes how Allied prisoners of war made use of the items provided by the "escape factory," but the most absorbing sections of the book reveal how maps, compasses, radios and other items were hidden inside softballs, bats, ping pong paddles, playing cards, packs of cigarettes and other objects, and smuggled into the stalags. A corporal at the time, Shoemaker was involved in the operation. One of his tasks was to obtain assistance of manufacturing firms in inserting escape aids into their products. A highly entertaining story about a unique wartime operation.

Now, we proudly welcome another of his lavishly illustrated classic tales: Snow White. <br>This exquisitely retold and newly designed edition remains faithful to the Grimms' beloved original. Featuring dreamy vistas, lush forests filled with animals, expressive characters, and an unforgettably beautiful heroine, it weaves a magical spell that will enchant children. <br></p><p>Charles Santore&#39;s many awards include the Society of Illustrators Award of Excellence, the prestigious Hamilton King Award and the Alumni Award of the Philadelphia College of Art. His work has been exhibited in New York&#39;s Museum of Modern Art and he has illustrated many other classic tales.Gr 1-3&#x2013;Lovely, broad paintings provide a rich sense of place and characters in this faithful rendering of the well-known tale. Snow White is a pretty child, the envious queen is haughty and wonderfully wizened in her disguises, and the dwarfs are distinctive individuals. Only the final wedding scene seems hastily assembled with the couple standing to one side on a white spread. Here Snow White and her prince unaccountably appear less mature than in the previous scene of their first meeting. Black-and-white endpapers in a busy vine pattern are a jolting contrast to the fulsome illustrations. Many of the best-known versions retain the Grimms' concluding emphasis on the death of the wicked stepmother, but this one softens the harsh lesson, giving readers a happily ever after statement about the bridal pair. For the most part this volume compares well with other retellings and will be a useful addition where needed.<i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Art critic at the Nation since 1984, the author calls himself a ``philosopher of art.'' An autobiographical introduction to this collection traces how he went from would-be artist to distinguished professor (Philosophy/Columbia Univ.) to wide-eyed art critic. Then, in 44 critical essays, Danto doggedly wrestles mostly with big New York museum shows of the last five years. In reviewing, he succeeds by being concrete, setting himself off from the ``visualism'' of formalist critic Clement Greenberg by looking first for meaning. Art often succeeds for Danto as a ``transformative experience''; two exemplars, Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol, pop up repeatedly. His summations have a willful, off- kilter freshness: in historical Chinese painting he discerns of- the-moment lit-crit ``intertextuality''; Mario Merz's retrospective is described as having aggressively ``occupied'' the Guggenheim Museum; he calls Vel&nbsp;zquez ``a master of conceptual drama.'' The book ends with five ``aesthetic meditations'': ``Art after the End of Art,'' ``Beauty and Morality,'' and the like. In these, Danto is craggier and rangier, summoning the spirits of Hegel and Wittgenstein. Feisty and opinionated throughout, Danto nonetheless shows himself to be a sucker for art that displays human spirit. He holds up art triumphantly as a ticklish enigma, a moral conundrum in our midst. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Danto's philosophically informed art criticism in these 41 reviews and essays bristles with erudition, eclectic taste and keen intellect. He evinces fresh perspectives and generous sympathies whether he is discussing Old Masters like Titian and Velazquez; moderns such as Picasso, Seurat and Kasimir Malevich; contemporary painters Francis Bacon and David Hockney; or sacred Tibetan art. Female artists are well-represented here, with perceptive pieces on Eva Hesse, Jenny Holzer, Helen Frankenthaler (whose paintings Danto compares to "inspired jazz"), Liubov Popova and Madeline Gins, who collaborates with her husband, Arakawa, on conceptual explorations of thought and writing. Professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and art critic for the Nation (where most of the selections first appeared), Danto sets forth meditations on contemporary aesthetics, the limits of art as a moral, suasive force and the role of the museum in shaping an image of a culture. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love/Penhaligion&#39;s Scented Treasury of Verse and Prose</h2><p>This scented treasury of verse and prose, selected by Sheila Pickles, is perfumed with Penhaligon&#39;s floral fragrance Elizabethan Rose.

In this interlnked quintet of novels, she creates a new, extraordinary cosmos where the fate of the Earth is influenced by the rivalries and interactions of three powerful galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius and their enemy, Puttiora.blending myth, fable and allegory, Doris Lessing's astonishing visionary creation both reflects and redefines the history of own world from its earliest beginnings to an inevitable, tragic self-destruction. <p><i>The Sirian Experiments</i> chronicles the origins of our planet, the three galactic empires fight for control of the human race. The novel charts the gradual moral awakening of its narrator, charts the charts the gradual moral awakening of its narrator, Ambien II, a 'dry, dutiful, efficient' female Sirian administrator. Witnessing the wanton colonisation of land and people, Ambien begins to question her involvement in such insidious experimentation, her faith in the possibility os human progress itself growing weaker every day.</p></p><p>'The story Ambien tells is a panorama of the posibilities of civilisation and barbarism, ranging from a matriarchal version of Atlantis to the Aztec cult of human sacrifice. Doris Lessing's interests are strictly terrestrial an the figures from outer space are there to serve as tellers of an earthly tale providing a new, sometimes startling, perspective on earthly affairs and a largeless of vision beyond the horizon of the conventional novel.' - Robert Alter, <i>New York Times</i> <p>'One of our greatest contemporary writers...Doris Lessing has invented a new cosmology to look at the world in new way: she is attempting to tackle nothing less than all human life on Earth.' - Financial Times</p>Doris Lessing was born of British parents in Persia (now Iran) in 1919 and was taken to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) when she was five. She spent her childhood on a large farm there and first came to England in 1949. She brought with her the manuscript of her first novel, The Grass is Singing, which was published in 1950 with outstanding success in Britain, in America, and in ten European countries. Since then her international reputation not only as a novelist but as a non-fiction and short story writer has flourished. For her collection of short novels, Five, she was honoured with the 1954 Somerset Maugham Award. She was awarded the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1981, and the German Federal Republic Shakespeare Prize of 1982. Among her other celebrated novels are The Golden Notebook, The Summer Before the Dark and Memoirs of a Survivor. Her short stories have been collected in a number of volumes, including To Room Nineteen and The Temptation of Jack Orkney; while her African stories appear in This Was the Old Chief&#39;s Country and The Sun Between Their Feet. Shikasta, the first in a series of five novels with the overall title of Canopus in Argos: Archives, was published in 1979. Her novel The Good Terrorist won the W. H. Smith Literary Award for 1985, and the Mondello Prize in Italy that year. The Fifth Child won the Grinzane Cavour Prize in Italy, an award voted on by students in their final year at school. The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 was made into an opera with Philip Glass, libretto by the author, and premiered in Houston.

He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography. <br>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh in 1859. After nine years in Jesuit schools, he went to Edinburgh University, receiving a degree in medicine in 1881. He then became an eye specialist in Southsea, with a distressing lack of success. Hoping to augment his income, he wrote his first story, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>. His detective, Sherlock Holmes, was modeled in part after Dr. Joseph Bell of the Edinburgh Infirmary, a man with spectacular powers of observation, analysis, and inference. Conan Doyle may have been influenced also by his admiration for the neat plots of Gaboriau and for Poe&#x2019;s detective, M. Dupin. After several rejections, the story was sold to a British publisher for �25, and thus was born the world&#x2019;s best-known and most-loved fictional detective. Fifty-nine more Sherlock Holmes adventures followed. Once, wearying of Holmes, his creator killed him off, but was forced by popular demand to resurrect him. Sir Arthur&#x2014;he had been knighted for this defense of the British cause in his The Great Boer War&#x2014;became an ardent Spiritualist after the death of his son Kingsley, who had been wounded at the Somme in World War I.

Adler's works-which range in date from 1911 to 1949-were truly American, offering an enormous range of stylistic expression on the exteriors and a simpler definition of interiors than traditional European models allowed. <p>This important book features seventeen homes and one private club designed by Adler, all of which are beautifully reproduced in full-color with newly commissioned photographs by the firm of Hedrich Blessing. Highlights of this volume include the Stuart-style country house in the manner of Sir Christopher Wren, built for Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Crane in Ipswich, Massachusetts; the Celia Tobin Clark residence, in Hillsborough, California, in which Adler used English half-timber construction; and the William McCormick Blair House, built in Lake Bluff, Illinois, a Colonial New England farm house that constituted a new experiment for Adler. </p><p>The book also presents examples of Adler's interior designs, which respond to the demands of modern life by featuring both the use of new materials and historical elements or furniture acquired during his European travels. </p><p>Other Adler homes featured in this book include: </p><p>Mrs. C.

Their friendship and collaboration began at Columbia College in the 1930s and reached its climax in the widely acclaimed magazine, which ran from 1953 to 1967, a year before Merton's death.. Rice was founder, publisher, editor, and art director; Merton and Lax two of his steadiest collaborators. Well-known on campus for their high spirits, avant-garde appreciation of jazz and Joyce, and indiscrimate love of movies, they also shared their Catholic faith. Rice, a cradle Catholic, was godfather to both Merton and Lax. &nbsp;Merton, who died some 30 years before the other two, was the first to achieve fame with his best-selling spiritual autobiography, <i>The Seven-Story Mountain</i>. Lax, whom Jack Kerouac dubbed "one of the great original voices of our times," eventually received recognition as one of "America's greatest experimental poets, a true minimalist who can weave awesome poems from remarkably few words" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent most of the last 35 years of his life living frugally on one of the remotest of the Greek isles. After <i>Jubilee</i> folded, Rice wrote 20 books on world culture, religion, and biography. His 1970 biography of Merton, <i>The Man in the Sycamore Tree</i>, was judged too intimate, forthright, and candid by those who, in Lax's words, "were trying so hard to get pictures of [Merton's] halo that they missed his face." His biography of the 19th century explorer and "orientalist" Sir Richard Burton became a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.</p><br><p>This book is not only the story of a 3-way friendship but a richly detailed depiction of the changes in American Catholic life over the past sixty-some years, a micro history of progressive Catholicism from the 1940s to the turn of the twenty-first century. Despite their loyalty to the church, the three often disagreed with its positions, grumbled about its</p><p>tolerance for mediocrity in art, architecture, music, and intellectual life and its comfortableness with American materialism and military power. And each in his own way engaged in a spiritual search that extended beyond Christianity to the great religions of the East.</p></p><p>"Jim Harford's Merton and Friends takes us on a marvelous journey with Merton, Lax, and Rice, three of the most complex and interesting spiritual figures of the twentieth century."--Marcia and Jack Kelly, authors of Sanctuaries: A Guide to Lodgings in Monasteries, Abbeys, and Retreats <p>"James Harford's insightful new biography, Merton and Friends, brings together Robert Lax, Thomas Merton, and Edward Rice in a fascinating story of how these three friends from Columbia days were able to encourage one another in their personal journey throughout their entire lives. Lax, born an upstate New York Jew, Merton, more cosmopolitan with European Protestant roots, and Rice, a Brooklyn-born Catholic, formed strong bonds of friendship as editors of Jester magazine at Columbia, and later united forces in their editing of Jubilee, the best U.S. publication of its kind. All three were artists and writers with enormous gifts, as this book clearly demonstrates.

It begins one fine morning with a few friends, honest laborers some of them, some close to being down-and-out, passing around a bottle of wine. It ends with a kind of satori-like reaffirmation of the power of friendship, of doing good through not doing, and the intrinsic worth of the throwaway little exchanges that make up our lives.<br><br>Written in 1957, the same year that <i>On the Road</i> was first published, and set in 1953, <i>Beat Generation</i> portrays an authentic and alternate 1950s America. Kerouac's characters are working-class men and women&#x2014;a step away from vagrants, but not a big step. Their dialogue positively sings, suggesting jazz riffs in their rhythm and content, and Kerouac, like a master composer, arranges it to magical effect. Here is the heart and soul of the beat mentality, the zeitgeist that blossomed over the decades and eventually culminated in the counter-culture of 1960s America. It's a spirit that still lives.</p><p>Jack Kerouac is one of America&#39;s most beloved and widely read authors. His ON THE ROAD helped shape what our country is today.

The<i> Odyssey</i> is the original hero&#x2019;s journey, an epic voyage into the unknown, and has inspired other creative work for millennia&#x2014;from ancient poetry to contemporary fiction and films. With its consummately modern hero, full of guile and wit, always prepared to reinvent himself in order to realize his heart&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;to return to home and family after ten years of war&#x2014;the <i>Odyssey</i> now speaks to us again across 2,600 years.<br> <br>In words of great poetic power, Stephen Mitchell&#x2019;s translation brings Odysseus and his adventures vividly to life as never before. Full of imagination and light, beauty and humor, this <i>Odyssey</i> carries you along in a fast stream of action and imagery. One-eyed maneating giants; irresistibly seductive sirens; shipwrecks and narrow escapes; princesses and monsters; ghosts sipping blood at the Underworld&#x2019;s portal, desperate for a chance to speak to the living; and the final destruction of all Odysseus&#x2019;s enemies in the banquet hall&#x2014;these stories are still spellbinding today. So, too, are the intimate moments of storytelling by the fire, of homecoming and reunion, fidelity and love&#x2014;all of greater value to Odysseus, and to us, than the promise of immortality.<br> <br>Just as Mitchell &#x201c;re-energised the <i>Iliad</i> for a new generation&#x201d; (<i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>), his <i>Odyssey</i> is the noblest, clearest, and most captivating rendition of one of the defining masterpieces of Western literature. Mitchell&#x2019;s muscular language keeps the diction close to spoken English, yet its rhythms re-create the oceanic surge of the ancient Greek. <br> <br>The first translation to benefit from modern advances in textual scholarship, Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Odyssey</i> also includes an illuminating introductory essay that opens the epic still further to our understanding and appreciation and textual notes that will benefit all readers. Beautiful, musical, accurate, and alive, this new <i>Odyssey</i> is a story for our time as well as for the ages.</p><p>Stephen Mitchell is widely known for his ability to make old classics thrillingly new. His many books include the bestselling <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, the <i>Iliad</i>,<i>&nbsp;Gilgamesh</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i>, <i>The Book of Job</i>,<i> Bhagavad Gita</i>, and <i>The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke.</i> His website is StephenMitchellBooks.com.The Odyssey Introduction<p></p> &#x201c;Sing to me, Muse&#x201d;<p></p> <br>If it had been practicable, I would have omitted the name &#x201c;Homer&#x201d; from the cover of this book. That&#x2019;s because, as most modern scholars think, the Odyssey was probably composed by a different poet from the poet of the Iliad. He was someone who knew the Iliad very well and copied many lines and passages from it, and while it is conceivable that both masterpieces could have been composed by the same person, the many important differences of vocabulary, grammar, geographical perspective, theology, and moral values make that unlikely. Since &#x201c;Homer&#x201d; is the name that I use for the poet of the Iliad (he was almost certainly not named Homer), I will call the Odyssey poet &#x201c;the Odyssey poet.&#x201d;<br> <br>We know almost nothing about the Trojan War, which is the theme or the background of the two poems and seems to have taken place around 1200 BCE. We know even less about the poets. There is no consensus about their dates, but there are good reasons to believe the eminent scholar Martin West, who places the Iliad somewhere between 670 and 640 BCE and the Odyssey between 620 and 600. It is remarkable that two geniuses flourished so close to each other in time, but no more remarkable than Aeschylus and Sophocles, Mozart and Beethoven, or Matisse and Picasso. Like Homer, the Odyssey poet was trained in the ancient tradition of oral poetry, and he used a language that had evolved over centuries, bearing signs of its history in its many archaic features and its mixed dialect. He went from town to town, or from noble house to noble house, to find new audiences and sang his poems to them in partly extemporaneous performance, accompanying himself on the phorminx (a four-stringed lyre), like the blind Demodocus in Book 8:<br> <br>The herald approached then, leading the honored poet<br> <br>whom the Muse loved beyond all others, granting him both<br> <br>good and evil: She stripped him of sight but gave him<br> <br>the gift of sweet song. The herald, Pont�no�s,<br> <br>set out for him a large chair, studded with silver,<br> <br>in the midst of the banquet and leaned it against a tall pillar,<br> <br>and he hung the beautiful clear-toned lyre on a peg<br> <br>a little above the singer&#x2019;s head, and he showed him<br> <br>how to reach up and take hold of it in his hands.<br> <br>And he put on a table beside him a basket of food<br> <br>and a cup of wine to drink when he felt the urge to.<br> <br>And they helped themselves to the food that was set before them.<br> <br>And when they had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted,<br> <br>the Muse moved the poet to sing of the glorious deeds<br> <br>of heroes.<br> <br>(8.58&#x2013;72)<br> <br>At some point the Odyssey poet wrote down or dictated his material, and in the course of many years he composed a poem far longer than anything that could be sung in a few hours or days. Sometimes he spliced passages from one place in the poem to another or added passages to an earlier draft, without covering his traces; in addition, many lines were later added by the professional rhapsodes who recited the poem to an avid public. But compared to epics in other traditions, the Odyssey, like the Iliad, has come down to us amazingly intact, over more than two and a half millennia.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sing to me, Muse,&#x201d; the Odyssey poet says in the first words of the poem. That is how he expressed what seems like the miracle of inspiration. Yet he wasn&#x2019;t merely waiting passively, as if he were taking dictation. He had at his command a large stock of traditional phrases, and even whole prefabricated scenes, which could be inserted into his poem; these allowed him to feel his way forward as he sang and gave him time to anticipate his next moves. It took a great deal of training to become a voice for the god, but beyond what he had learned, there was something new and exciting that happened each time he sang, and he believed that he was a vessel for the divine, a medium through whom a vaster, clearer intelligence was able to speak. So it isn&#x2019;t surprising that Odysseus says, in perhaps the earliest blurb on record, that there is no man on earth he admires more than the poet Demodocus (this from a man who was a comrade-in-arms of the great Achilles). The Odyssey poet saw no contradiction between his own masterful autonomy and the impersonality, the transpersonality, of his song, as he shows us in the Phaeacian king&#x2019;s praise of Demodocus:<br> <br>&#x201c;To him beyond any other<br> <br>the god has given the gift of song, to delight us<br> <br>in whatever way his spirit moves him to sing.&#x201d;<br> <br>(8.41&#x2013;43)<br> <br>The song is god-given, yet what the poet follows is his own spirit. His own spirit is the voice of the god, for as long as he is singing. The greater the poet, the more individual his song, the more distinguished from the run-of-the-mill performer who simply strings together traditional phrases, and thus the more inspired it is. In the same way, Phemius, the Ithacan poet, says,<br> <br>&#x201c;I am self-taught; in my mind the god has implanted<br> <br>songs of all kinds.&#x201d;<br> <br>(22.310&#x2013;11)<br> <br>In the Odyssey the audience always responds to &#x201c;the god-inspired poet&#x201d; with intense emotion. As Odysseus listens to the tale of his own exploits at Troy, he can barely contain his sobbing. Penelope too, hearing a poet sing of Troy, is so powerfully disturbed that she begs him to stop. But for everyone else who hears them, the poems are an experience of unalloyed delight. The Greek word is terpein, &#x201c;to have pleasure or joy, to delight in,&#x201d; and it is the same word that is used in describing life on Olympus, where the gods &#x201c;spend their long days in pleasure.&#x201d; The Odyssey poet couldn&#x2019;t imagine a greater human happiness than being at a dinner party where a gifted poet is performing. &#x201c;It is a fine thing,&#x201d; Odysseus says,<br> <br>&#x201c;to be listening to a poet<br> <br>such as this, who is like the immortals in speech.<br> <br>For I think that there is no more complete fulfillment<br> <br>than when joy takes over an audience in the great hall,<br> <br>and the banqueters are sitting next to each other<br> <br>listening to the poet, and beside them the tables<br> <br>are loaded with bread and meat, and the steward carries<br> <br>the drawn wine around and fills their cups to the brim.<br> <br>This seems to me the most beautiful thing in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>(9.2&#x2013;10)<br> <br>There are two other Greek words that the poet uses to describe the effect of poetry; both come from verbs that mean &#x201c;to enchant, bewitch, put a spell on.&#x201d; The Phaeacian king compares Odysseus&#x2019;s eloquence to a poet&#x2019;s, and when Odysseus pauses during the long account of his wanderings, &#x201c;throughout the shadowy palace / all who had listened were silent, seized by enchantment.&#x201d; The nightmare version of this power to spellbind is the Sirens:<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyone who in ignorance hears their alluring<br> <br>voices is doomed; he never goes home to find<br> <br>his wife and beloved children rejoicing to see him,<br> <br>for the Sirens bewitch him with their exquisite music<br> <br>as they sit in a meadow, surrounded by massive heaps<br> <br>of dead men&#x2019;s bones with the flesh still rotting upon them.&#x201d;<br> <br>(12.40&#x2013;45)<br> <br>Only a people who were entirely susceptible to the beauty of words would think of projecting poetry&#x2019;s negative image in such a hair-raising way.<br> <br>Most of us read the Odyssey because we have to, as a school assignment, or because we think we should. (It is, after all, one of the foundational works of Western literature; Goethe called it and the Iliad &#x201c;the two most important books in the world.&#x201d;) What surprises many readers is that it still has the power to enchant. I discovered it as a ten-year-old, after my teacher had us trace Flaxman&#x2019;s spear-carrying, helmet-and-negligee-clad Athena onto drawing paper. Athena was the goddess of wisdom, she told us, and while &#x201c;wisdom&#x201d; meant nothing to me at the time, I was impressed that the goddess had popped straight out of Zeus&#x2019;s head, in a reversed form of the virgin birth that I had first heard about the Christmas before. The Odyssey wasn&#x2019;t on our sixth-grade reading list, but I found a children&#x2019;s version in the library and plunged right in. One-eyed man-eating ogres, self-navigating ships, ghosts sipping blood at the entrance to the underworld, shipwrecks, nymphs, princesses, witches, disguises, recognitions, and, to top it all off, a wholesale slaughter of bad guys at the end! What could be more exciting?<br> <br>Reading the Odyssey, we enter a world infused by the imagination, &#x201c;cleared of its stiff and stubborn, man-locked set.&#x201d; Everything becomes fresh and new; familiar objects light up with an inner radiance, as if we were seeing the sky or smelling the grass for the first time. And we are always carried along by the steady yet constantly varying rhythms of the meter, which serves as a counterpoint to even the most horrific events, so that everything we read is lifted up into the realm of the beautiful.<br> <br>No detail is too small to escape the poet&#x2019;s attentive gaze, no dream image too fantastic to be made humanly accessible. The six-headed, razor-toothed, tentacled monster Scylla, for example, might easily have seemed cartoonish in the hands of a lesser poet, but she is presented to us so clearly, and her murderous attack described with such elegant precision, that she bursts into existence, as appalling as we could wish:<br> <br>&#x201c;At that very moment Scylla rushed out and snatched<br> <br>six of my comrades&#x2014;beautiful, strong young men.<br> <br>I looked up and saw their arms and legs thrashing above me,<br> <br>and they shouted to me and called out my name for the last time.<br> <br>And as a fisherman stands on a jutting rock<br> <br>and casts the bait with his rod, and the bronze hook sinks<br> <br>into the water, sheathed in an ox-horn tube,<br> <br>and he catches a fish and reels it in quickly and flings it,<br> <br>writhing, onto the shore: just so were my comrades,<br> <br>writhing, pulled up toward the cliffs, and at the cave entrance<br> <br>she ate them. They screamed and kept stretching their hands out toward me<br> <br>in their hideous final agony. That was the most<br> <br>sickening thing I ever saw on my travels.&#x201d;<br> <br>(12.229&#x2013;41)<br> <br>And here is a picture of the Phaeacian princess Nausic�a and her handmaids washing the royal laundry. (It&#x2019;s a passage that shocked the sniffy classicists of later ages, who thought that doing laundry was beneath the dignity of a princess.)<br> <br>They came at last to the banks of a beautiful stream,<br> <br>where the washing basins were always filled with clear water<br> <br>welling up through them, to clean the dirtiest clothes.<br> <br>Here they unyoked the mules from the wagon and sent them<br> <br>along the stream to graze on the rich, sweet clover,<br> <br>then lifted the clothes from the wagon and carried them down<br> <br>into the basins, and each girl began to tread them,<br> <br>making a game to see who could finish first.<br> <br>And when they had washed off the dirt and the clothes were spotless,<br> <br>they spread them neatly along the shore, where the sea<br> <br>lapped at the land and washed all the pebbles clean.<br> <br>After a swim, they rubbed themselves with the oil<br> <br>and had their lunch on the bank of the eddying river<br> <br>and waited there for the clothing to dry in the sun.<br> <br>And when they had finished the meal, they took off their head scarves<br> <br>and played a ball game, tossing the ball and dancing<br> <br>to the rhythm, while Naus�c�a led them in song.<br> <br>(6.87&#x2013;103)<br> <br>One more example. After ten years of war at Troy and ten years of further hardships, Odysseus is finally given voyage home in one of the magical Phaeacian ships.<br> <br>And he went aboard, and at once he lay down in silence,<br> <br>and the crew took their places along the ship by the oarlocks<br> <br>and untied the mooring cable from the pierced stone.<br> <br>And as soon as they leaned back and churned up the sea with their oar blades,<br> <br>a profound sleep fell on his eyelids, sweet and unbroken,<br> <br>the image of death. As when a team of four stallions<br> <br>leap forward together, feeling the lash of the whip<br> <br>and lifting their hooves up high as they race down the track:<br> <br>just so did the stern of the ship keep leaping and plunging,<br> <br>and the dark-blue waves surged thunderously in her wake<br> <br>as she hurried to finish the journey. Not even a falcon,<br> <br>the fastest of wing�d creatures, could have kept up,<br> <br>so lightly did she run on and cut through the waves,<br> <br>bearing a man whose wisdom was like the gods&#x2019; wisdom,<br> <br>who for twenty years had suffered so many hardships<br> <br>as he passed through the wars of men and the bitter sea.<br> <br>But now he was sleeping peacefully, free from all troubles.<br> <br>(13.79&#x2013;95)<br> <br>Like the Scylla passage, these lines contain one of those extended similes that are among the glories of the Iliad. (The Odyssey poet uses them much less often.) The compliment about Odysseus&#x2019;s wisdom is a formulaic one, like the embroidered phrases that a courtier might address to a king. We aren&#x2019;t meant to press the phrase too closely but to enter the sense of temporary fulfillment that the poet has kindly given his main character in an &#x201c;infinite sleep&#x201d; that ends the first half of the poem. This is a coda that brings us back to the tonic chord, and its combination of speed and deep calm is a marvel.<br> Longing for Home<p></p> <br>Though the architecture of the Odyssey is subtle and elegant, its plot couldn&#x2019;t be simpler. Here is how Aristotle describes it:<br> <br>A man has been away from his country for many years; he is harassed by Poseidon and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in danger&#x2014;suitors are consuming his property and plotting to kill his son. Finally, battered by the elements, he comes home, reveals his identity to certain people, attacks the suitors and kills them, and comes through safe himself. That is the essence; the rest is episodes.<br> <br>Folklorists call this type of story &#x201c;The Return of the Husband&#x201d; or &#x201c;The Return of the Rightful King&#x201d; and find it in many different cultures, from different ages, all over the world.<br> <br>Odysseus is the hero, and we are on his side not only because the story is structured for that, but because in many ways he is really admirable. We are told by Penelope that before he left home he was an exemplary king:<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t they [the suitors] hear from their fathers when they were children<br> <br>how splendid a king Odysseus was, how he treated<br> <br>everyone in this country? Never, in word<br> <br>or in deed, did he act with injustice toward any man.&#x201d;<br> <br>(4.636&#x2013;39)<br> <br>This matters for everyone in Ithaca, because the welfare of a whole country depends on the righteousness of its king:<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some virtuous king<br> <br>who acts with justice and reverence for the gods,<br> <br>and in his kingdom the soil yields wheat and barley,<br> <br>and the trees are always heavy with fruit, and the flocks<br> <br>bear young without fail, and the deep sea abounds with fish,<br> <br>and the people flourish, because he knows how to lead.&#x201d;<br> <br>(19.113&#x2013;18)<br> <br>He has also been a good husband, if we judge by Penelope&#x2019;s twenty-years-long devotion to him and by his own heartfelt experience of marriage, as expressed to Nausic�a:<br> <br>&#x201c;I pray that the gods will grant you your heart&#x2019;s desire,<br> <br>a good home and a good husband, and harmony<br> <br>between the two of you. Nothing is sweeter than that,<br> <br>when a man and a woman can live together as one,<br> <br>with one mind and heart.&#x201d;<br> <br>(6.184&#x2013;88)<br> <br>But he isn&#x2019;t a hero in the Iliad&#x2019;s sense of the word.

But he was also deeply involved in the political and religious controversies of his time. Fully immersed in the new and rapidly changing print culture, Milton wrote a series of radical pamphlets on free speech, divorce, and religious, political, and social rights that proposed a complete rethinking of the nature and practice not only of government, but of human freedom itself.<br>Having put his pen at the service of Parliament against King Charles, and his Latin at the service of Cromwell's new commonwealth, when the Restoration came Milton was lucky to escape with his life. By then completely blind, he persevered, creating the majestic works that made him immortal.<br>For centuries Milton has emerged from biographies either as a blind, saintly figure removed from the messy business of personal affections, or as a woman-hating domestic tyrant. Yet as Anna Beer shows, he was neither ogre nor paragon. Milton had intense and often troubled relationships with both men (such as his early, passionate friendship with Charles Diodati) and women (throughout his three marriages).<br>By closely examining all aspects of Milton's life&#x2015;his poetry, his prose, his Latin writings, his careful editing of his own biography, the records of his government work, and the social and political history of England during one of its most tumultuous periods (an era that ran from Shakespeare's plays to Samuel Pepys's diaries)&#x2015;Anna Beer succeeds in bringing a celebrated and enigmatic writer to vivid life on the four hundredth anniversary of his birth.</p></p><p><p>Anna Beer is lecturer in literature and a fellow of Kellogg College at the University of Oxford. She is the author of the acclaimed <i>Bess: The Life of Lady Ralegh, Wife to Sir Walter</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;It's a crucial part of the biographer's job to lead readers back through the life to the work.

Beer's Milton is a writer of prodigious creativity, in Latin and English, prose and verse, but he always relates to his time and place, in the teeming, cruel streets of London and the brilliant academies of Italy. She gives us clear, common-sense readings of the literature, vivid evocations of the social and political world, and probing yet sympathetic analyses of Milton's own emotional states, when he was &#x2018;in love with a man' or an ideal. The biographer and the subject share the qualities that he himself most valued in poetry: simple, sensuous and passionate.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Grantham Turner, author of One Flesh: Paradisal Marriage and Sexual Relations in the Age of Milton and Schooling Sex: Libertine Literature and Erotic Education in Italy, France, and England 1534-1685</i></p><p>&#x201c;Anna Beer offers the most readable biography yet of the author of the most important poem in the English language.

The result is <b>Lemon Swamp</b>, Mamie Garvin Fields' memories of her childhood and her life as an educated black woman in early twentieth-century Charleston, South Carolina. Born in 1888, Mamie Fields was part of an extended family and a large neighborhood. Keeping track of all the names and places makes the early chapters hard work, but there's a reason for the details, and almost every one has a story. Mamie Fields tells of Charleston parks where blacks were not allowed to sit on the benches, and describes jubilant picnics in the country, filled with food, families, dancing, and hide-and-go-seek. There is her grandfather's plantation, with its Lemon Swamp, where her grandmother was "lost" during Sherman's march. And there are the schools on the Sea Islands - "a place behind God's back" - where Mamie Fields taught. In <b>Lemon Swamp</b>, Mamie Fields remembers what blacks were not allowed to do in the South and won't let anybody forget what they accomplished. When other teachers told her "'Don't bother with the white people to get necessities for your school'...[her] attitude was 'He's a man and he speaks English. I will ask him.' " She did ask and she did accomplish - often without asking. She's a remarkable woman, and together she and her granddaughter bring a remarkable history to life. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Certain People: America&#39;s Black Elite</h2><p>On the basis of his research on markedly different circles in Black society, the author provides a view of the Black haut monde and explores the rationale for class distinctions within America&#39;s Black population</p><p></p><h2>The Falcon and the Snowman</h2><p>The true story of two typical American youths who attempt to penetrate one of the super-secret military installations in the country--and succeed</p><p>Tense, intriguing, and darkly compelling, The Falcon and the Snowman is a uniquely American story of betrayal. On the face of it, there was nothing to indicate that Andrew Dalton Lee and Christopher James Boyce were anything but two devout Catholic boys growing up in happy, warm families in one of the most affluent suburbs in America, living one version of the American Dream and facing nothing but the best of futures.Bright and idealistic, the son of a former FBI agent, 21-year-old Boyce was adrift in the malaise and disenchantment of the late 1960s. His high school friend Dalton Lee had wandered from his childhood days as an altar boy to become a successful drug dealer in trouble with the law and looking for the big score. In July of 1974 Boyce's father used his influence to help his son get a job at TRW, a Southern California aerospace company that was developing and manufacturing satellites used by the CIA. Less than a year later Boyce and Lee launched a plan to sell the CIA's secrets to the Russians and began a career as Soviet agents, complete with international intrigue, secret codes, clandestine meetings, and miniature cameras. The Falcon and the Snowman is, ultimately, a dark story of murder plots, betrayal, and the wrenching consequences of impulsive decisions. Intensively researched, it draws on hundreds of interviews with all the principals involved, on letters, and on materials from Boyce and Lee's eventual trials.

When the call came to Graham Burnett, a young historian, he had a shock in store. A Trial by Jury is his startling account of how performing this familiar civic duty challenged him in ways he never thought possible and turned into one of the most consuming experiences of his life.<br><br>Burnett begins with the story of the trial: a body with multiple stab wounds found in a New York apartment, intimations of cross-dressing, male prostitution, mistaken identity. And then, the unexpected drama: Burnett finds himself appointed the foreman, with the responsibility of leading the increasingly frenetic deliberations within the black box of the jury room. <br><br>Soon he is sequestered&#x2014;which is to say marooned&#x2014;with eleven others, a group of people who view their task, and often one another, with palpable distaste. Among his colleagues: a vacuum-cleaner repairman cum urban missionary, a young actress, and a man apparently floundering in a borderland between real life and daytime television. <br><br>As Burnett steers the contentious politics of their temporary no-exit society toward the verdict, he undergoes an unexpected awakening. Having been plucked from his cozy nest in the world of books and ideas and then plunged into the netherworld of lurid crime, he learns the limits of what intellect alone can accomplish in the real world. Above all, Burnett discovers firsthand the terrifying ultimate power of the state and the agonies of being asked to do justice within the rigid dictates of the law.<br><br>Part true crime, part political treatise, part contemplation of right, wrong, and the power of words, <i>A Trial by Jury</i> is a mesmerizing narrative of one man&#x2019;s encounter with crime and punishment, American style. It profoundly affects one&#x2019;s sense of the privileges&#x2014;and the perils&#x2014;of citizenship.</p><p>Historian D. Graham Burnett writes about his experience as the foreman of the jury in a murder trial in New York City, what he calls "the most intense sixty-six hours of my life." There was nothing especially spectacular about the case; it was not a famous one, and while <i>A Trial by Jury</i> holds interest, it's not a John Grisham potboiler. Yet Burnett uses the experience to illuminate the heavy responsibilities of jury duty and all the maddening frustrations associated with determining something as deceptively simple as reasonable doubt. <p> "The jury room is a remarkable--and largely inaccessible--space in our society, a space where ideas, memories, virtues, and prejudices clash with the messy stuff of the big, bad world," Burnett writes in this elegant chronicle. His primary characters--his fellow jury members--come alive on these pages: "a clutch of strangers yelled, cursed, rolled on the floor, vomited, whispered, embraced, sobbed, and invoked both God and necromancy." He grows to like some, and "loathe" others. ("Are there some citizens not clearly able to distinguish daytime television from daily life?" he asks at one point.) Parts of the book are funny, as when he describes the small steps he took to encourage the trial lawyers to strike him out of the jury pool: "I promised to give any healthy prosecutor hives. I brought along a copy of <i>The New York Review of Books</i> just in case." Alas, Burnett found himself in the courtroom, and eventually he became foreman. This allows him to wrestle through the contradictory evidence presented by both sides--and forces him to conclude that even the truth can resemble a muddle when presented in court. He has trouble making up his own mind about the case--this is no <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> update, though its insights on jury-room dynamics are just as instructive. Burnett also ruminates on his own profession: "I realize now that for me--a humanist, an academic, a poetaster--the primary aim of sustained thinking and talking had always been, in a way, <i>more thinking and talking</i>. Cycles of reading, interpreting, and discussing were always exactly that: cycles. One never 'solved' a poem, one read it, and then read it again--each reading emerging from earlier efforts and preparing the mind for future readings." Jury duty, of course, demands an awesome finality--and the conclusion to the trial involving Burnett is one that haunts the author after the gavel falls. <i>--John Miller</i></p>"As fascinating as any fictional courtroom thriller and a lot more thought-provoking than most . . . Burnett has a keen intelligence and he's a gifted writer--the book holds you in its grip."<br> --Charles Matthews, <i>Mercury News</i> <br><br>"A minor masterpiece, a mesmerizing story of a system that would be right at home in a Franz Kafka story. In many ways, <i>[A Trial by Jury </i>is] downright chilling . . . It opens a window on a closed, substantially flawed process . . . Burnett's prose is crystal clear. . . . This is a fascinating story."<br> --Leo Irwin, <i>Sunday News Journal </i>(Wilmington, DE)<br><br>"[Burnett illustrates] what a remarkable and sometimes remarkably strange duty serving on a jury can be . . . A riveting look at citizen jurors at work."<br> --Seth Stern, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"A drama both human and metaphysical . . . a report from the trenches . . . It's not just the defendant who is on trial in <i>A Trial by Jury,</i> but the jury system and the jurors themselves."<br> --James Traub, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The heavy machine is what Burnett calls the criminal justice system; his close encounter with its well-greased wheels and levers is the subject of his immensely readable new book."<br> --Jabari Asim, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>"By turns humorous and dramatic, "A Trial by Jury" speeds along; it can be devoured in a single sitting. Burnett is a graceful, economical writer, with a sharp eye for detail and a nuanced feel for character. He never loses his sense of the ridiculous . . . An irresistible book."<br> --Barry Gewen, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>"The author, a historian of science, also proves himself an excellent student of human nature in this first-person account of serving as the jury foreman in a New York City murder trial. Though the entire case, from opening gavel to final decision, takes only a few weeks, Burnett manages to paint vivid portraits of his fellow-jurors and examine the knottier issues of class, race, and gender that complicate the justice system's search for objective truth. Until now, the standard-bearer for jury-room dynamics has been "Twelve Angry Men"; Burnett's narrative, while significantly more understated, is no less illuminating."<br> <i>--The New Yorker </i><br><i><br></i><br>"A slender, finely wrought book . . . unfailingly astute . . . That <i>A Trial by Jury</i> can be read in a few engrossing hours is an unexpected treat for busy professionals. That it is written with a grace and eloquence all too rare in contemporary nonfiction is icing on the cake. That it may actually make us better and more thoughtful lawyers and citzens is the kind of marvelous prestidigitation worthy of our best teachers."<br> --Peter H. Schuck, <i>New York Law Journal<br><br></i>This book is a journey down into the grim boiler room of justice. Those who make this journey never forget the experience. They emerge seeing the world in a different <br>way, and you'll understand why after reading this book.<br><br> --Jonathan Harr, author of <i>A Civil Action<br><br></i>"D. Graham Burnett's <i>A Trial By Jury</i> is the passionate, honest and humane true story of a murder trial and the torments of the jurors as they try to decide guilt or innocence. This jewel of a book describing a brutal, quirky killing tells us as much about the pain suffered by people having to make overwhelming decisions as it does about the good and bad of the American criminal justice system. Not since <i>12 Angry Men</i> have we been so vividly brought inside the jury room and shown how 12 people--including the author--ultimately choose between justice and the law."<br> --Martin Garbus, author of <i>Tough Talk<br><br></i></p><h2>What I Saw</h2><p>This book of readings is intended for students of Russian who have had at least one semester of study. It has a glossary and notes on facing pages and a complete glossary at the end. The copiously illustrated text of this book is a copy of portions of the 1939 edition.

It makes business cycle theory accessible to a whole new 21st-century audience. And they need it, especially those under 40. Many of the brilliant quants working on Wall Street and at the Fed barely remember the Crash of 2008, much less understand it. But Mark Thornton does, and his book is a warning about overheated equity markets, over-inflated housing prices, and clueless central bankers. Given the shaky stock markets lately, 2018 may be the year the Fed&#x2019;s latest bubble bursts. And when it does, it will be even more painful than 10 years ago. In fact, US household and business debt is now one trillion dollars higher than 2008. Mark is well known as an expert on bubbles and Fed malfeasance. His work appears in outlets like Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Forbes, The Economist, Barron&#x2019;s, and Investor&#x2019;s Business Daily. His now-infamous Skyscraper Index theory draws the connection between loose monetary policy, artificially low interest rates, and vanity construction projects. Put the three together and it doesn&#x2019;t turn out well. And let&#x2019;s not forget that Dr. Thornton was among only a handful of economists to warn about the dangerous housing bubble in 2004, and again in 2006. Cabbies and waiters bought up condos with no money down in places like Las Vegas. Prices rose 25 percent or more every year in some coastal markets. Even people with terrible credit financed houses at five or seven times their annual income. All of it was made possible by the Fed and its mania for low interest rates. So when the experts said &#x201c;Nobody could have seen this coming,&#x201d; the Mises Institute had Mark&#x2019;s articles and papers ready to go. The housing crash, and the meltdown in equity markets less than a year later, were thoroughly explained by Austrian business cycle theory. And Mark was the capable face of the Mises Institute during it all. Without a lay-friendly book like The Skyscraper Curse, millions more Americans will be duped by the next crash. Dr. Thornton&#x2019;s book tells the story that needs to be told. It will be among the only alternative explanations available when the next crisis comes.</p><p></p><h2>KENSUKE&#39;S KINGDOM</h2><p>Michael&#39;s parents buy a yacht, and take him off to sail round the world. Washed overboard in a fierce storm, Michael finds himself on the shore of a remote island - and soon discovers he&#39;s not alone. Kensuke, a former Japanese soldier, survived the war and the bombing of Hiroshima, but his family perished. As an extraordinary bond forms between the two, Kensuke faces a heart-breaking choice: can he give up the secluded life he&#39;s built for himself to help reunite Michael with his parents? Knowing the pain of losing his own family, Kensuke knows which way he has to decide...</p><p>Loved by children, teachers and parents alike, Michael Morpurgo, the last Children&#39;s Laureate, has written more than forty books and won the Whitbread Award, the Smarties Award, the Circle of Gold Award, the Children&#39;s Book Award and has been short-listed for the Carnegie Medal four times.Grade 4-8-This poignant adventure story begins in England in 1988 and ends halfway around the globe in a place that will change the 11-year-old protagonist forever. After losing his job, Michael's father surprises the family by purchasing a yacht in which they will sail around the world. In the first weeks at sea, Michael, his parents, and his dog, Stella, zigzag from England to Australia and across the Coral Sea, where Michael's reverie comes to a frightening end. In the middle of the night, he and Stella are swept overboard in a fierce storm, and he later awakens on an island beach. The island is a hostile jungle full of howling gibbons, voracious mosquitoes, and brutal heat, all of which challenge his ability to survive. Yet when he finds fresh water and food mysteriously laid out for him each morning, he realizes that he is not alone. He soon comes face-to-face with Kensuke, an old Japanese soldier who cautiously protects Michael in spite of the boy's dogged determination to build a bonfire that will signal potential rescuers, defying Kensuke's wish that the outside world never learn of his existence on the island. For nearly a year, the man and boy help each other, moving from an uneasy d&#x201a;tente to a deep friendship. What might have been just a gritty tale of survival evolves into a gentle parable about trust, compassion, love, and hope. This well-crafted story has all the thrills and intrigues of Gary Paulsen's Hatchet (Macmillan, 1986) and Theodore Taylor's The Cay (Avon, 1976), and it will resonate with the same audience.<br><i>William McLoughlin, Brookside School, Worthington, OH</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gold rush narrow gauge: The story of the White Pass and Yukon Route</h2><p>96 pages of excellent text, filled with great photos and illustrations.

But the poem above is a folk couplet&#x2015;a <i>landay</i>, an ancient oral and anonymous form created by and for mostly illiterate people: the more than 20 million Pashtun women who span the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. War, separation, homeland, love&#x2015;these are the subjects of <i>landays</i>, which are brutal and spare, can be remixed like rap, and are powerful in that they make no attempts to be literary. From Facebook to drone strikes to the songs of the ancient caravans that first brought these poems to Afghanistan thousands of years ago, <i>landays</i> reflect contemporary Pashtun life and the impact of three decades of war. With the U.S. withdrawal in 2014 looming, these are the voices of protest most at risk of being lost when the Americans leave.<br> After learning the story of a teenage girl who was forbidden to write poems and set herself on fire in protest, the poet Eliza Griswold and the photographer Seamus Murphy journeyed to Afghanistan to learn about these women and to collect their <i>landays</i>. The poems gathered in <i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> express a collective rage, a lament, a filthy joke, a love of homeland, an aching longing, a call to arms, all of which belie any facile image of a Pashtun woman as nothing but a mute ghost beneath a blue burqa.</p></p><p><p><b>Eliza Griswold,</b> a Guggenheim fellow, is the author of a collection of poems, <i>Wideawake Field</i> (FSG, 2007) and a nonfiction book, <i>The Tenth Parallel: Dispatches from the Fault Line Between Christianity and Islam</i> (FSG, 2010), a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that was awarded the J.

Flanked by Murphy's photographs, with their striking blend of wartime journalism and human compassion, Griswold's couplets are peppered with brief prose passages in which she delves into cultural and historical traditions that inform the humor and gravity of her translations . . .<b> a collection that may indeed be remembered as a groundbreaking work of translation and poetic journalism</b>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eliza Griswold and Seamus Murphy have made a book that is necessary reading for anyone who has ever made assumptions from a distance about what a burka-wearing woman might be like, and for anyone who cannot fathom how poetry could get you killed.

The poems, equally art and reportage, are often poignant, more often witty, even pungent. They, along with the accompanying text and photographs, illuminate the beauty of the country and its culture, the sadness of its history, and the humor, the hopes, the bitterness, and even the contradictions its women-no different than women anywhere-carry in their hearts.

With all the humour and humanity that have made his novels so enduringly popular, this collection brings Pratchett out from behind the scenes of the Discworld to speak for himself -- man and boy, bibliophile and computer geek, champion of hats, orang-utans and Dignity in Dying.</p><p><p>TERRY PRATCHETT is the acclaimed creator of the global bestselling Discworld series, the first of which, <i>The Colour of Magic, </i>was published in 1983.

First serial, Vanity Fair.</p><p><b>Chapter One: Romance</b><br><br> In romance what do you seek? Something new and Other, although you don't quite know what it is? For me romance is a yearning not fully conscious, but what I find is always the search for something else, a renewal and a hope for transformation. The creative risk-taking of passionate love not only gives you the chance to change the past, it gives the imagination one more chance at an exciting future.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Gloria VanderbiltNot surprisingly, it takes an older woman to write a great kiss-and-tell memoir&#x2014;who else would have enough lovers under her belt? Vanderbilt opens with an appetizer of schoolgirl sex with a chum from Miss Porter's School in the 1930s and then regales readers with a star-studded cast of intimates&#x2014;Howard Hughes, Leopold Stokowski, Bill Paley, Marlon Brando, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, among others. Some were one-night-stands, some torrid affairs; three or four she even married. Romance, after all, is "the search for something else, a renewal and a hope for transformation in life." In her less giddy moments, Vanderbilt considers how some of this relentless love-affairing may have been provoked by an unhappy childhood. She was only 10 when her mother lost custody of her in an infamous public trial; young Gloria was sent to live with cold Aunt Gertrude Whitney. When she was 21 and inheriting her fortune, husband Stokowski persuaded her to cut off financial support for her mother, which alienated mother and daughter for another 20 years. While there's a little venting about men who've swindled her, it's the dishy gossip&#x2014;Paley chasing her around the sofas in his living room, Truman Capote basing <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> on life at her brownstone&#x2014;that keeps the pages turning. Even in the last chapter, Vanderbilt's going on about some man who's "the Nijinsky of cunnilingus." Ah, toujours l'amour!

Nancy Mitford lovingly tells the story of how the little girl rose, against a backdrop of savage social-climbing, intrigue, excess and high drama, to become the most powerful women of the eighteenth century French court, Le Pompadour.</p><p>Nancy Mitford was born in London on November 28 1904, daughter of the second Baron Redesdale, and the eldest of six girls. Her sisters included Lady Diana Mosley; Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire and Jessica, who immortalised the Mitford family in her autobiography Hons and Rebels. The Mitford sisters came of age during the Roaring Twenties and wartime in London, and were well known for their beauty, upper-class bohemianism or political allegiances. Nancy contributed columns to The Lady and the Sunday Times, as well as writing a series of popular novels including The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, which detailed the high-society affairs of the six Radlett sisters. While working in London during the Blitz, Nancy met and fell in love with Gaston Palewski, General de Gaulle&#39;s chief of staff, and eventually moved to Paris to be near him. In the 1950s she began writing historical biographies - her life of Louis XIV, The Sun King, became an international bestseller. Nancy completed her last book, Frederick the Great, before she died of Hodgkin&#39;s disease on 30 June 1973.&#34;My favourite biography is Nancy Mitford&#39;s Madame de Pompadour - a famous 18th-century French beauty who became Louis XV&#39;s mistress. The secret of a good biography is not just to tell the person&#39;s story but to create the world in which they lived.&#34; -- Julian Fellowes * Daily Express * &#34;Mitford brings warmth to everything she touches, and her biography of Madame de Pompadour is testimony to that&#34; -- Justine Picardie * Sunday Telegraph * &#34;Reads as if an enchantingly clever woman was pouring out the story to me on the telephone&#34; -- Raymond Mortimer &#34;Nancy Mitford excels in depicting both the brilliant romantic showcase and the recessed world of power... No historian writing in English has given a better pen-picture of Versailles in its heyday&#34; * Time * &#34;Incontestably her best book, Madame de Pompadour is beautifully written in a rapid, nervous, gay and enthusiastic manner which carries the reader through from first page to last&#34; -- Cyril Connolly * Sunday Times *</p><h2>Introduction to Hermeneutics: How to Interpret the Bible (An Independent-Study Textbook)</h2><p>Handbook on how to interpret the Bible.</p><p></p><h2>Alaskan Adventures</h2><p>Ernest Hemingway called Annabel the finest outdoor writer.</p><p>Russell Annabel was one of America&#39;s most outstanding and gifted outdoor writers; in fact, Ernest Hemingway said Annabel was &#34;the finest outdoor writer&#34; that he had ever read-an endorsement most writers can only dream about! Annabel started writing of his adventures in the Northland in the 1930s and continued writing until the late 1970s. Follow Annabel and his mentor, Tex Cobb, around in Alaska as they face enraged grizzlies, trophy Dall sheep, marauding wolverines, and mad moose. No other writer has ever been able to capture the spirit of adventure and hunting in Alaska like Russell Annabel. This book was an instantaneous sellout, in print less than eight months.

From struggling war refugees to monks, intellectuals to sex workers, his characters are both linked and separated by their experiences as modern Asians and Asian Americans.<br><br>In styles ranging from naturalism to high-camp parody, Leong goes beneath stereotypes of immigrant and American-born Chinese, hustlers and academics, Buddhist priests and street people. Displacement and marginalization &#x2015; and the search for love and liberation &#x2015; are persistent themes. Leong&#x2019;s people are set apart, by sexuality, by war, by AIDS, by family dislocations. From this vantage point on the outskirts of conventional life, they often see clearly the accommodations we make with identity and with desire. A young teen-ager, sold into prostitution to finance her brothers&#x2019; education, saves her hair trimmings to burn once a year in a temple ritual, the one part of her body that is under her own control. A documentary film producer, raised in a noisy Hong Kong family, marvels at the popular image of Asian Americans as a silenced minority.

It is also a love story about living in the city, something exceedingly rare in teen fiction, and while decidedly set in 1982 (with a fun foray back to the pre-WWII era), it has a contemporary realistic feel. Nothing terrifying happens in this book, nothing horrifying or disturbing. The divorce is tough, but August learns to voice his feelings and navigate an honest path with his mother who is a wonderful sort of parent who gives him the kind of freedom that most tweens dream about. The most refreshing thing about this novel was how I didn't have to worry about it the kids have their big secret but it's a fun secret, a secret of parks and picnics and skating down the halls of the National Gallery. It's a secret that hurts no one and readers are allowed to simply enjoy how the friendships unfold and the revelations are made. The People of Pineapple Place is a perfect title for precocious younger readers who want a secret, but not something to worry about. --Colleen Mondor, Bookslut</p><h2>Excel Saga, Volume 13</h2><p>Seeking global domination, would-be dictator Il Palazzo forms a secret society based deep beneath the streets of Fukuoka, Japan called ACROSS, and his first member is Excel, a teenaged girl smitten with him.</p><p></p><h2>The Ginormous Book of Dirty Jokes: Over 1,000 Sick, Filthy and X-Rated Jokes</h2><p><strong>THE BIGGEST, BADDEST, BADASSEST BOOK OF LEWD, CRUDE AND FUNNY-AS-$#!+ JOKES</strong><br><br><strong>�What did the two lesbian frogs say to each other? <em>We do taste like chicken!</em><br><br>�What does a blonde put behind her ears to make her more attractive? <em>Her ankles.</em><br><br>�The journalist asked the politician, &#x201c;Your assistant said publicly that you have a small penis.

With the rise of British Christianity in various parts of ancient Britain, it played a fundamental, yet pivotal role in maintaining and shaping the baptismal practice of single immersion in the name of Christ alone. At least from the time of Tertullian of Carthage as testified by the Church Historian, Eusebius of Caesarea to the acclaimed British born and first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine who oversaw and officiated the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D, the entrance of Christianity into Britain was seen to resist Roman and Papal authority and jurisdiction, thereby minimizing any Roman influence and dominance, resulting in the excommunication of the British Church. The British Church with is religious practices became a thorn in the side of the Roman Church, but continued to exercise its religious freedoms in accordance with the apostolic message. Therefore, contained within this work is reference to an array of literature, publications and prominent figures who noted baptism in the name of Jesus only or Christ alone from within Britain since the ancient period till the present. Great Britain has been home to baptism in the name of Jesus only for centuries and hundreds of years, coupled with theological belief of the British and European people of sabellianism derivative from the New Testament with an Old Testament foundation. </p></p><p></p><h2>Sean Connery</h2><p><p><strong>A biography of a star and an investigation of what can happen to a man when the images he creates take over his life.</strong></p> Sean Connery's creation of secret agent James Bond invigorated Britain and its cinema, allowing a cash-strapped, morale-sapped country in decline to fancy itself still a player on the world stage.

Braun passed away in 2011.While the 10th entry in the "Cat Who" series is enjoyable and has its charms, it is less a mystery than a recital of how veteran reporter and millionaire Jim Qwilleran and his feline companions, Koko and Yum Yum, spent their vacation, and an account of the people they encountered. Moreover, most of the plot development occurs near the end, so the denouement appears contrived. Fiftyish bachelor "Qwill" decides to spend the summer at a lakefront cottage near the resort town of Mooseville. His vision of an idyllic respite is shattered from the moment he arrives. Almost everything in the house needs repair and Qwill could use more space; adding a wing is the logical solution, but he learns that most such jobs are done by itinerant builders. Fortunately, Clem Cottle, a local handyman, accepts the project, but he soon disappears, the third carpenter in recent months to vanish; two others met with fatal freak accidents. When Clem's replacement, Iggy Small, misses work, and his corpse is found in Qwill's basement, our vacationing hero suspects a serial killer and begins to investigate. Of course, the intelligent Koko helps solve the crime. For inveterate Braun ( The Cat Who Sniffed Glue ) fans only.

In a unique mix of fact and fiction, each chapter is followed by background information and hands-on activities. Kids will learn about life on a cotton plantation, about abolitionists who fought to have slavery made illegal, and about the heroic actions of Canadians who sheltered runaway slaves.

She lives in Toronto, Ontario.Grade 3-6-A book that is part novel, part history lesson, and part activity guide. Surprisingly, Greenwood succeeds on all counts. The story revolves around a Canadian family's participation in the Underground Railroad in 1856. Johanna Reid, 12, must live with Eliza, an escaped slave, as Eliza waits to be reunited with her mother and brother, who did not make it to the safety of the Reids' home. Johanna learns to cope with her own prejudices as she comes to see Eliza as a friend. Interspersed with the girls' story of friendship are brief descriptions of life on a plantation and the Underground Railroad: how it worked, who risked their lives to escape or help others flee, and who profited from catching a fugitive slave. The information is often specific to Canada, but readers in the U.S. will not find the book unbalanced. The activities include songs and storytelling as well as directions for making a cornhusk doll, a lantern for a window (a signal on the Underground Railroad), and gingerbread cookies. Sepia drawings appear on almost every page, giving the book an open look. There is a rather paltry index considering the amount of information relayed.

Lippard writes about the place she has lived for a quarter century. The history of a place she refers to as Pueblo Chico (little town) is based largely on other people&#x2019;s memories&#x2015;those of the descendants of the original settlers in the early 1800s, heirs of the Spanish colonizers and the indigenous colonized who courageously settled this isolated valley despite official neglect and threats of Indian raids. The memories of those who came later&#x2015;Hispano and Anglo&#x2015;also echo through this book. But too many lives have already receded into the land, and few remain to tell the stories. The land itself has the longest memory, harboring traces of towns, trails, agriculture, and other land use that goes back thousands of years. The Galisteo Basin is a cultural landscape that has become familiar to Lippard, simultaneously enriched with the stories she has been told by longtime residents and veiled by those she has not been told. From its inception, Galisteo has been about the vortex of land and lives, about the way the land reveals its coexistence with humans, the ways people have changed it, and the ways the land has in turn changed the people who lived here long enough to become part of it. Complementing the history are two hundred historical and contemporary images, many provided by Galisteo&#x2019;s citizens and heirs.</p><p>Lucy R. Lippard is an internationally known arts critic and writer. She is the author of over twenty books, has curated more than fifty major exhibitions, and is recipient of numerous awards including the Caroline Bancroft History Prize for Down Country: The Tano of the Galisteo Basin, 1250&#x2013;1782 (MNMP). Other books include The Lure of the Local: Senses of Place in a Multicentered Society, and Undermining: A Wild Ride Through Land Use, Politics, and Art in the Changing West. In 2018 she received a New Mexico Governor&#x2019;s Award for Excellence in the Arts.

She wishes she hasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&nbsp;Chances are: Louise hasn&#x2019;t slept much. She works as a barista at this coffee shop that turns into a wine bar at night, and also writes for this e-commerce site called GlaZam that sells knockoff handbags, and is also an SAT tutor. She sets an alarm for at least three hours before she has to be anywhere, because she lives deep in Sunset Park, a twenty-minute walk from the R, in the same illegal and roach-infested sublet she&#x2019;s been in for almost eight years, and half the time the train breaks down. When they call her, once every couple of months, Louise&#x2019;s parents invariably ask her why she&#x2019;s so stubborn about moving back to New Hampshire, say, where <i>that nice Virgil Bryce</i> is a manager at the local bookstore now, and he won&#x2019;t stop asking for her new number. Louise invariably hangs up.</p><p>She weighs herself. Louise weighs one hundred fourteen and a half pounds on a period day. She puts on her makeup very carefully. She draws on her brows. She checks her roots. She checks her bank balance (sixty-four dollars, thirty-three cents). She covers up the flaws in her skin.</p><p>She looks in the mirror.</p><p><i>Today</i>, she says&#x2014;out loud (a therapist she had once told her that it&#x2019;s always better to say these things out loud)&#x2014;<i>is the first day of the rest of your life</i>.</p><p>She makes herself smile. Her therapist told her to do that, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Louise walks the twenty minutes to the subway. She ignores the catcaller who asks her, every morning, how her pussy smells, even though he&#x2019;s probably the only person in the world she interacts with regularly. She spends the ride into Manhattan staring at her reflection in the darkened subway windows. Back when Louise was sure she was going to be a go-down-in--history Great Writer she used to take a notebook and use the commute to write stories, but now she is too tired and also she probably will never be a writer; so she reads trashy <i>Misandry!</i> articles on her phone and sometimes watches peo- ple (Louise enjoys watching people; she finds it calming; when you spend a lot of time focusing on the things wrong with other people you worry less about everything wrong with you).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Louise goes to work as a barista, or at GlaZam, or to give an SAT lesson.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes lessons best. When she speaks with her very carefully cul- tivated mid-Atlantic accent and puts her very carefully dyed blonde hair into a bun and alludes to the fact that she went to school in Devonshire, New Hampshire, she gets $80 an hour, plus the satis- faction of having fooled somebody. Now if Louise had actually gone to Devonshire Academy, the boarding prep school, and not just the public Devonshire High, she&#x2019;d get $250, but the kind of parents who can pay $250 are more assiduous in checking these things.</p><p>Not that most people ever check these things. When Louise was sixteen, she took to leaving her house early and eating breakfast and dinner at the Academy&#x2019;s dining hall. She made it a whole three months, watching people, before anybody noticed, and even then it was just her mother who found out, and grounded her, and by the time she was allowed out of the house again she&#x2019;d started AIM- chatting Virgil Bryce, who didn&#x2019;t like it when she went anywhere without him. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Louise finishes work.</p><p>She looks in her phone-mirror, a few times, to make sure she&#x2019;s still there. She checks Tinder, even though she hardly responds to anybody she matches with. There was one guy who seemed really feminist online but turned out to practice relationship anarchy; and another who was really into kink in ways that she was never entirely sure were not abusive; and one guy who was really great, actually, but he ghosted her after two months. Sometimes Louise considers going out with somebody new, but this seems like just another thing to potentially fuck up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, if Louise has been paid cash that week, she goes to a really nice bar: on Clinton or Rivington, or on the Upper East Side.</p><p>She orders the nicest drink she can afford (Louise can&#x2019;t really afford to be drinking at all, but even Louise deserves nice things, sometimes). She sips her drink very, very slowly. If she doesn&#x2019;t eat dinner (Louise never eats dinner) the alcohol will hit her harder, which is a relief, because when Louise gets drunk she forgets the invariable fact that she is going to fuck everything up one day, if she hasn&#x2019;t already, whether it&#x2019;s because she loses all her jobs at once and gets evicted or because she gains twenty pounds because she is too tired to exercise and then not even the catcaller will want to fuck her or because she&#x2019;ll get throat cancer from all the times she has made herself throw up all her food or because she will get another kind of even rarer and more obscure cancer from all the times she obsessively dyes her hair in a bathroom without ventilation or she will fuck up by unblocking Virgil Bryce on social media or else because she will get into another relationship in which a man who seems nice on Tinder wants to save her, or else to choke her, and she will do whatever he says because the other way to fuck it all up is to die alone.</p><p>Louise waits until she sobers up (another very certain way to fuck up is to be a drunk woman alone in New York at night), and then she takes the subway home, and although Louise no longer writes in her notebook, if she is still tipsy enough to feel that the apocalypse is no longer imminent she tells herself that tomorrow, when she is that little bit less tired, she will write a story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They say if you haven&#x2019;t made it in New York by thirty, you never will.</p><p>Louise is twenty-nine. </p><p>Lavinia is twenty-three. </p><p>This is how they meet:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lavinia&#x2019;s sister, Cordelia, is sixteen. She&#x2019;s at boarding school in New Hampshire&#x2014;not Devonshire Academy but one of its rivals. She&#x2019;s home for Christmas break. Their parents live in Paris. Lavinia found one of Louise&#x2019;s SAT TUTOR?

I can pay. How much does a person pay for these things? You tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One fifty an hour,&#x201d; says Louise.</p><p>&#x201c;Done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start tonight,&#x201d; Louise says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lavinia lives in a floor-through brownstone apartment on Seventy- eighth Street between Park and Lex. When Louise arrives on the stoop, there is opera blaring from an open window, and Lavinia is singing along, off-key, and this is how Louise figures out that Lavinia lives on the second floor without even having to check the buzzer.</p><p>Lavinia has flowers in all of her window boxes. All of them are dead.<br><br>Lavinia answers the door in a sleeveless black dress made entirely of feathers. Her hair comes down to her waist. It is wild, and coarse, and she has not brushed it in days, but it is the hue of blonde Louise has spent many hours experimenting with drugstore dyes to achieve, only it is natural. She is not tall but she is thin (Louise tries to calculate exactly how thin, but the feathers get in the way), and she fixes her eyes on Louise with such intensity that Louise instinctively takes a step back: half--knocking into a vase filled with dead lilies.</p><p>Lavinia doesn&#x2019;t notice.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>Cordelia is sitting at the dining-room table. She is wearing her hair in one long thick braid, coiled and pinned. She doesn&#x2019;t look up from her book.</p><p>There are antique hand fans all over the walls. There is a gold- embroidered caftan hanging on a wall, and a powdered wig on the head of a mannequin whose features are drawn in lipstick, and there are several illustrated tarot cards&#x2014;the High Priestess, the Tower, the Fool -- in rusty art nouveau frames on all the surfaces in the room. The walls are all a regal, blinding blue, except for the moldings, which Lavinia has made gold.</p><p>Lavinia kisses Louise on both cheeks.</p><p>&#x201c;Make sure she goes to bed by ten,&#x201d; she says, and leaves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She does that.&#x201d;</p><p>Cordelia finally looks up.</p><p>&#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t really that oblivious,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just her sense of humor.

And you.&#x201d;</p><p>Louise doesn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; says Cordelia. &#x201c;I started studying already.&#x201d; Her smile twists at the edges.</p><p>She makes Louise a pot of tea.</p><p>&#x201c;You can have chocolate-vanilla or you can have hazelnut- cinnamon-pear-cardamom,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Vinny doesn&#x2019;t have any normal tea.&#x201d;</p><p>She serves it in an intricately patterned teapot (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Uzbeki- stan,&#x201d; Cordelia says. Louise doesn&#x2019;t know if this is a joke). She sets it down on a tray.</p><p>Cordelia forgets a teaspoon, although there is one in the sugar pot, but after the second cup Louise realizes if she stirs the tea it will wet the spoon and then ruin the sugar. If she keeps the spoon dry the sugar will settle in the cup.</p><p>Louise sips her tea without any sugar in it. She briefly considers asking for another spoon, but the thought of doing this makes her nervous, and so Louise doesn&#x2019;t say anything at all.</p><p>They do SAT words: <i>What is the difference between</i> lackluster, laconic, <i>and</i> lachrymose? They do math: all the 3-4-5 triangles, sur- face areas of different shapes.

I don&#x2019;t really need a tutor. Don&#x2019;t feel bad&#x2014;I mean, you&#x2019;re doing a very good job. Sorry. It&#x2019;s just&#x2014;I know all this already.&#x201d; She shrugs. &#x201c;Maybe Vinny really does want you to be my babysitter.

Romero lives in Queens, New York, and Moskowitz lives in Portland, Oregon.<br>Starred Review. While most vegan cookbooks are anemic, underfed volumes-some no-brainer pasta recipes, a few things to do with tofu, maybe some oddball desserts-this slam-bang effort from vegan chefs Moskowitz and Romero (Vegan with a Vengeance) is thorough and robust, making admirable use of every fruit and vegetable under the sun, without once asking readers to make do with fake meat products and egg replacements. Instead, the eccentric authors offer dozens of novel, delicious ways to get excited about eating meat-, dairy- and egg-free. Take Southwestern Corn Pudding, a winning casserole rich with coconut milk and an unexpected dash of maple syrup-a likely MVP at your next Thanksgiving (whether it's centered around turkey or tofu). Almost as addictive are Rustic White Beans and Mushrooms, which get their bite from fresh herbs, and Lentils and Rice with Caramelized Onions and Spiced Pita Crisps, a transcendent Middle Eastern comfort food. Vegan breakfasts get overdue attention: sitting in front of a hot stack of velvety Blueberry Corn Pancakes and hearty Blue Flannel Hash, who's going to miss the bacon? Best of all is the wide selection of terrific desserts: everything from Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies to decadent Caramel-Apple-Spice Cupcakes boldy fill the space where most eggless, milkless and butterless cookbooks fear to tread. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her plan will take her far from her mother&#x2019;s claustrophobic house, where the family photos have all been turned to face the wall; far from the influence of her domineering father&#x2015;a professor of Islamic studies&#x2015;and his new wife.</p><p>Aden&#x2019;s dream, however, is worlds removed from conventional fantasies of teen rebellion: she is determined to travel to Peshawar, Pakistan, to study Islam at a madrasa. To do so, she takes on a new identity, disguising herself as a young man named Suleyman. Aden fully commits to this new life, even burning her passport to protect her secret. But once she is on the ground, she finds herself in greater danger than she could possibly have imagined. Faced with violence, disillusionment, and loss, Aden must make choices that will test not only her faith but also her most fundamental understanding of who she is, and that will set her on a wild, fateful course toward redemption by blood.

Kiernan and Tim Powers</b></p> <p><strong>Tim Powers</strong><strong> is the author of numerous novels, including Declare, Last Call, and On Stranger Tides, the inspiration for the blockbuster film "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. Powers lives in San Bernardino, California.</strong></p> <p><strong>Tim Powers: </strong>Where did you get the initial idea for the book? </p> <p><strong>Stephen P. Kiernan:</strong> I heard a song by James Taylor and thought it would make a good novel. But I stewed on the idea for 18 years, because it had a missing ingredient I couldn&#x2019;t identify. Then I was biking in Italy with two writer friends, and one night I shared both the story and my problem with it. One friend said: &#x201c;It needs a beautiful woman.&#x201d; The other added, &#x201c;Who is smarter than everyone else.&#x201d; Geniuses. After that, the book nearly wrote itself. The final novel bore as much resemblance to the song as an oak does to an acorn, but that initial nut was essential. </p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>You&#x2019;ve written nonfiction for decades. <em>The Curiosity</em> is your first novel. Was it easier or harder to write?</p> <p><strong>SPK:</strong> Imagine an artist painting a still life without the actual fruit and flowers in front of him. He must work without the benefit of light on the apples just so, and without the discipline of rendering the peonies precisely as he sees them. But he also has the freedom to add pomegranates, if he thinks it will make a better picture. This novel was like that, both liberating and challenging, with the writing entirely in service of the story.</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>My work often draws on historical facts as a plot foundation. Your novel draws similarly on science. How much research did you do? How close is the book&#x2019;s &#x201c;re-animation&#x201d; to actual science today?</p> <p><strong>SPK:</strong> As a longtime reporter, I trusted research to make the book credible, and hoped it would also spark my imagination. I did tons of homework, learning not just cell science but the culture of high powered labs. That&#x2019;s how I discovered that my book&#x2019;s science fiction was only months ahead of reality. Research seems to me a matter of openness: Studying early baseball for one scene, for example, I learned about a tune the fans sang a century ago whenever their team won. That song later became an important plot point, though I&#x2019;d begun the novel not even knowing it existed.</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>You could have awakened a man from any time and place. Why did you chose 1906 Massachusetts? </p> <p><strong>SPK:</strong>I suppose my curious man could have been a Neanderthal, but I wanted a character, not a cartoon. The smarter he was, the more insightful and judicious, the better he would reflect on our time and culture in a meaningful way. Remember, too, that Mary Shelley&#x2019;s Frankenstein was a philosopher who spoke five languages.</p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> How important is it for a book to have a happy ending? Would you say your novel ends happily?</p> <p><strong>SPK:</strong> Stories contain many kinds of happiness, from he-won-the-race to they-lived-happily-ever-after. Happiness in <em>The Curiosity</em> is more ambiguous, but hopefully richer as a result. The central arc for the book&#x2019;s primary character is about a self-discovery that is both deep and lasting. Her growth comes at a huge cost &#x2013; a career, a broken heart. But the woman at the novel&#x2019;s end has embarked on a better course for her life, free of striving to satisfy others, truer to her brilliant mind and generous spirit. </p><p>A powerful debut novel in which a man, frozen in the Arctic ice for more than a century, awakens in the present day and finds the greatest discovery is love . . .</p><p><em>The Curiosity </em></p><p>Dr. Kate Philo and her scientific exploration team make a breathtaking discovery in the Arctic: the body of a man buried deep in the ice.

It was made into a major film, DESERT FURY, starring Burt Lancaster, Lizabeth Scott and Mary Astor. It&#x2019;s the story of seventeen year old Paula Haller&#x2019;s transition into womanhood as she defies her mother, Fritzi&#x2019;s dominance. Fritzi runs the small town of Chuckawalla including the Purple Sage casino and saloon as well as a bordello or two. Fritzi can control everything but Paula and the tension between the two is drawn as tight as a drum. The scenery includes sprawling ranches, a very much out of place colonial mansion and the vast beauty of the desert. Mix in a notorious gangster, his insanely jealous torpedo, a love triangle, the town sheriff, some weirdly eccentric characters and innuendo aplenty. Once the sun brings all these ingredients to a boil you&#x2019;ve got the backdrop for a noir setting like no other.</p><p></p><h2>Street without Joy: The French Debacle in Indochina</h2><p>A poignant, angry, articulate book Newsweek &#39;Mr Fall&#39;s book is a dramatic treatment of a historic event graphic impact New York Times Originally published in 1961, before the United States escalated its involvement in South Vietnam, Street Without Joy offered a clear warning about what American forces would face in the jungles of Southeast Asia; a costly and protracted revolutionary war fought without fronts against a mobile enemy. In harrowing detail, Fall describes the brutality and frustrations of the Indochina War, the savage eight-year conflict, ending in 1954 after the fall of Dien Bien Phu, in which French forces suffered a staggering defeat at the hands of Communist-led Vietnamese nationalists. Street Without Joy was required reading for policymakers in Washington and GIs in the field and is now considered a classic.</p><p>Bernard B. Fall was born in France and fought with the French Resistance during World War II. While traveling in Vietnam in 1967, he was killed by a Vietcong explosive.

She had no idea that she was about to start the greatest Red Scare in U.S. history.<br><br>Bentley (1908-1963) was a Connecticut Yankee and Vassar graduate who spied for the Soviet Union for seven years. She met with dozens of highly placed American agents who worked for the Soviets, gathering their secrets and stuffing sensitive documents into her knitting bag. But her Soviet spymasters suspected her of disloyalty--and even began plotting to silence her forever. To save her own life, Bentley decided to betray her friends and comrades to the FBI.

Over thirty years ago (from 1989), the man who did such important, pioneering work in Kon-Tiki wrote another best-selling book, Aku-Aku, about Easter Island. More recently, Heyerdahl was invited to return to Easter Island and there confronted the conundrum of the famous, haunting statues that stud the lovely island, massive and mysterious. How were they made? How were they moved? What did the natives mean when they had said, those many years earlier, that &#34;the statues walked&#34;? Who made them--and where did the Easter Islanders themselves come from? What did earlier visitors discover--or believe? It is characteristic of Dr. Heyerdahl&#39;s many explorations that his research, his theories, his conclusions all are entwined with objectives greater than mere adventure. Just as his expeditions have been partly in pursuit and proof of his theories that early man traveled further (and faster) than others had previously suspected, and that the peoples of many cultures can work together peacefully, his probes into the past are coupled with an enduring, endearing conviction--never before displayed better than in this volume--that just as we must avoid prejudice in the present, we should not look down on the peoples of the past--for they and we have more in common than it might seem.</p><p><b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> was a pioneer in the field of experimental archaeology. His 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition proved that the Incas were capable of sailing across the Pacific. He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1964, and was voted the Norwegian of the Century in 2000.

Her mother left Tibet in her youth as a refugee and lived in exile the rest of her life, always yearning to return home. When the author arrives at the foothills of her mother's ancestral home in a nomadic village in East Tibet, she realizes that she had been preparing for this homecoming her whole life.<i> Coming Home to Tibet</i> is Dhompa's evocative tribute to her mother, and a homeland that she knew little about. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhompa's story is interlaced with poetic prose describing the land, people, and spirit of the country as experienced by a refugee seeing her country for the first time. It's an intriguing memoir and also an unusual inside view of life in contemporary Tibet, among ordinary people trying to negotiate the changes enforced on it by Chinese rule and modern society.</p><p>TSERING WANGMO DHOMPA is the first Tibetan female poet to be published in English. Her first book of poems, <i>Rules of the House</i> (Apogee Press, 2002) was a finalist for the Asian American Literary Awards in 2003. She was raised in India and Nepal and is fluent in several languages and dialects--including Tibetan, Hindi, and Nepali. Tsering received her BA from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University, her MA from University of Massachusetts in Amherst, and her MFA in Creative Writing from San Francisco State. Her poetry articulates the nostalgia of displaced Tibetans, recording the memories of elders in Tibetan communities.&#x201c;Tsering Wangmo Dhompa is a poet who straddles several worlds and languages. In <i>Coming Home to Tibet,</i> she writes beautifully of her life, her family, Tibet&#x2019;s astonishing landscape, and the tragedy of its contemporary political situation. As a Tibetan, Dhompa sees the traditional culture of her homeland lovingly. As a Westerner, she sees its shortcomings. So this book is a blessing for those of us interested in Tibet: it paints a sensitive and detailed portrait, from the inside, that is both critical and sympathetic.<br><br> As a Buddhist concerned about transmission of the tradition to the West, <i>Coming Home to Tibet</i> gave me a lot to think about. To what extent is Buddhism, as Western adherents generally see it, a psychology and philosophy divorced from its cultural moorings&#x2014;and to what extent do we fundamentally misunderstand Buddhism when we look at it that way? And in that misunderstanding, do we lose a great deal of the goodness Buddhism might offer us? Dhompa does not engage such questions abstractly: her personal reflections, as an educated Tibetan Westerner, provide more powerful food for thought about this question than any theoretical discussion could.<br><br> With all this, <i>Coming Home to Tibet </i>is essentially a personal memoir about Dhompa's late mother and the life they led in exile, until her mother's tragic death in an auto accident in Nepal. It is a moving love story about two extraordinarily brave women walking hand in hand through one of the most heart-rending tragedies of our lifetime.&#x201d;&#x2014;Norman Fischer, author of <i>What is Zen?</i> and <i>Training in Compassion</i></p><h2>The Rough Guide to Spain (Rough Guides)</h2><p>Discover Spain with the most incisive and entertaining guidebook on the market.

G. Sebald: A Critical Companion (Literary Conjugations)</h2><p>Likened to Proust, Gunter Grass, and Virginia Woolf, <i>W. G. Sebald</i> (1944-2001) is one of the most important writers of our time, combining a wide readership with universal critical acclaim. Sebald&#x2019;s refracted and sometimes alienated views of both his native Germany and his adopted English homeland have had astonishing resonance in the German- and English-speaking worlds. In this first collection to appear in English, newly commissioned essays by leading international scholars offer interdisciplinary perspectives on Sebald&#x2019;s work, providing a thorough assessment of his achievement.<br><br>Sebald&#x2019;s texts deal with issues that lie at the very heart of contemporary culture: memory, exile, identity, representation, history, the Holocaust. His texts are hybrid in nature, mixing fiction, biography, historiography, travel writing, and memoir, and incorporating numerous photographic images. In response to this, <i>W. G. Sebald: A Critical Companion</i> focuses on the key areas of travel, intertextuality, nature, and memory.<br><br>Introductory chapters situate Sebald&#x2019;s work within the European literary tradition and within contemporary critical discourse. Individual chapters then draw on approaches from cultural and literary studies, including ecocriticism, trauma theory, and text-image studies, in order to explore aspects of Sebald&#x2019;s dazzling oeuvre. A comprehensive bibliography of primary and secondary sources rounds off the volume, which will satisfy a growing need for a high-quality and up-to-date guide to Sebald&#x2019;s work for an English-speaking readership. The interdisciplinary nature of the Companion means that it will appeal not only to students and critics working on Sebald, but to anyone interested in contemporary culture.</p><p><p>The first critical collection on the work of <i>W.

What if Hitler had invaded Britain? What if Kennedy had lived? What if Russia had won the Cold War? Niall Ferguson, author of the highly acclaimed <i>The Pity of War</i>, leads the charge in this historically rigorous series of separate voyages into imaginary time&#x201d; and provides far-reaching answers to these intriguing questions.Ferguson's brilliant 90-page introduction doubles as a manifesto on the methodology of counter-factual history. His equally masterful afterword traces the likely historical ripples that would have proceeded from the maintenance of Stuart rule in England. This breathtaking narrative gives us a convincing, detailed alternative history&#x201d; of the West from the accession of James III&#x201d; in 1701, to a Nazi-occupied England, to a U.S. Prime Minister Kennedy who lives to complete his term.</p><p>This meaty, scholarly collection of essays by gifted historian Niall Ferguson tackles the controversial topic of counterfactual questions: What if Hitler had invaded Britain in WWII? What if JFK had survived his assassination? What if there had been no Gorbachev to usher in the collapse of Communism? What if there had been no American Revolution? Ferguson points out that while questions such as these are a vital part of how we learn as individuals ("What if I had observed the speed limit, or refused that last drink?"), there remains a great deal of resistance--even hostility--to such musings among professional historians. "[I]n the dismissive phrase of E.H. Carr, 'counterfactual' history is a mere 'parlour game,' a 'red herring.'" E.P. Thompson is less charitable, calling counterfactual histories "'<i>Geschichtswissenschlopff</i>', unhistorical shit."<p> But Ferguson and his distinguished collaborators (many of whom are also Oxford fellows) lodge some convincing counterfactuals of their own to counter this arguably blinkered notion, this "idea that events are in some way preprogrammed, so that what was, had to be." In addition to the what-ifs above, Ferguson and his comrades tackle eight questions in all, including "What if Charles I had avoided the Civil War?", "What if Home Rule had been enacted [in Ireland] in 1912?", and "What if Britain had 'stood aside' in August 1914?" <i>Virtual History</i> makes for a stimulating and intellectually rigorous trip, with Ferguson's own delightful afterword as the collection's crowning jewel, a brilliant--and often bitingly clever--timeline tying together all the threads from 1646 to 1996. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Niall Ferguson</b> is Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at Jesus College, Oxford.

And the puppets, marionettes, and other forms that figure so vividly and provocatively in modernist and avant-garde drama can, according to Harold Segel, be regarded as Pinocchio's progeny.</p><p>Segel argues that the philosophical, social, and artistic proclivities of the modernist movement converged in the discovery of an exciting new relevance in the puppet and marionette. Previously viewed as entertainment for children and fairground audiences, puppets emerged as an integral component of the modernist vision. They became metaphors for human helplessness in the face of powerful forces&#x2015;from Eros and the supernatural to history, industrial society, and national myth. Dramatists used them to satirize the tyranny of bourgeois custom and convention, to deflate the arrogance of the powerful, and to breathe new life into a theater that had become tradition-bound and commercialized.</p><p> <i>Pinocchio's Progeny</i> offers a broad overview of the uses of these figures in European drama from 1890 to 1935. It considers developments in France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia. In his introduction, Segel reviews the premodernist literary and dramatic treatment of the puppet and marionette from Cervantes' <i>Don Quixote</i> to the turn-of-the- century European cabaret. His epilogue considers the appearance of puppets and marionettes in postmodern European and American drama by examining works by such dramatists as Jean-Claude Van Itallie, Heiner M�ller, and Tadeusz Kantor.</p></p><p><p><b>Harold B. Segel </b> is professor of Slavic and comparative literature at Columbia University. His many books include the two-volume <i>Turn-of-the-Century Cabaret</i>, <i>Renaissance Culture in Poland</i>, and <i>Twentieth-Century Russian Drama</i>, the latter available from Johns Hopkins.</p><p>Excellent critical analyses... <i>Pinocchio's Progeny</i> should have wide appeal to theater professionals and certainly shoud be on the shelf of all puppeteers, amatuer or professional.

Sayers: Her Life and Soul</p><p></p><h2>Secret Faith in the Public Square: An Argument for the Concealment of Christian Identity</h2><p>In this groundbreaking and provocative book, Jonathan Malesic argues that the best way for Christians to be caretakers of their tradition and to love their neighbors selflessly is to conceal their religious identity in American public life. The alternative insisting on Christianity&#39;s public visibility in politics, the marketplace, and the workplace risks severely compromising the distinctiveness of Christian identity. Delving deep into the Christian tradition, Malesic explains that keeping Christian identity secret means living fully in the world while maintaining Christian language, prayer, and liturgy in reserve. He shows how major thinkers Cyril of Jerusalem, S�ren Kierkegaard, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer sought to protect Christian identity from being compromised by the public sphere. He then shows that Christians&#39; dual responsibilities for the tradition and for the neighbor must be kept secret.</p><p>"Against all the arguments that religious conviction should be manifest in public life, Jonathan Malesic offers perhaps the most theologically profound, fruitful, and rigorous challenge: the real truth of Christianity cannot be worn like a flag pin on a politician's lapel. It occurs in secret and in silence. True subjectivity of faith precludes its manifestation in public life, and all attempts to display it in such a way only profane it and further pervert the church as a community of 'secret disciples.' This genuinely fresh, freethinking book displays the independence of mind and life for which it argues. Lucidly written and crisply argued, it is a significant contribution to discussions in the field, and will be a wonderful counterpoint to the dominant narrative in classes about religion and public life."--<b>Charles Mathewes</b>, University of Virginia; editor, <i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion<br><br></i>"Malesic's thesis is striking and provocative: we should conceal our faith in order to protect it from being absorbed and prostituted in our voracious secular culture. Readers may not be persuaded, but by the end of the book they will find themselves richly rewarded with many fresh insights into the possibilities for Christian witness in our strange, postmodern era. A truly fresh contribution to the important debate about faith, politics, and culture."--<b>R. R. Reno</b>, Creighton University<br><br>"Jonathan Malesic calls Christians in America to conceal their identities in public life as a form of therapy that unhinges Christian witness from its accommodation to public expectation and reward. By credibly challenging the assumption that Christian identity is only authentic if it is publicly visible and explicit, Malesic has transformed the conversation about the relationship of the church to the world at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This book should be read and discussed widely."--<b>Bryan Stone</b>, Boston University School of TheologyJonathan Malesic (Ph.D., University of Virginia) is assistant professor of theology at King&#39;s College in WilkesBarre, Pennsylvania.

It has always occupied a privileged position in the Church: no guide ever written provides so complete, so balanced and so practical an approach to the spiritual life. Written for the layman surrounded by worldliness, this is a masterpiece of mystical and devotional literature, by a great and much loved Doctor of the Church. This book does what many similar books fail to do, teach the reader to grow in holiness, step by simple step. St. Francis de Sales was a master psychologist, with a special gift for teaching practical morality. His writings are characterized by sublime common sense. Even non-Christians have admired his prose. Above all, he is a spiritual genius, and thus was made a Doctor of the Church.

His perennial meekness and sunny disposition won for him the title of Gentleman Saint.</p><h2>Food for the Dead: On the Trail of New England&#39;s Vampires</h2><p>Forget Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula. In nineteenth-century New England another sort of vampire was relentlessly ravishing the populace, or so it was believed by many rural communities suffering the plague of tuberculosis. Indeed, as this fascinating book shows, the vampire of folk superstition figures significantly in the attempt of early Americans to reasonably explain and vanquish the dreaded affliction then known as consumption. In gripping narrative detail, folklorist Michael E. Bell reconstructs a distant world, where on March 17, 1892, three corpses were exhumed from a Rhode Island cemetery. One of them, Mercy Brown, who had succumbed to consumption, appeared to have turned over in her grave. Mercy's family cut out her heart, which still held clots of blood, burned it on a nearby rock, and fed the ashes to her ailing brother. To Mercy's community she had become a vampire living a spectral existence and consuming the vitality of her siblings. From documents written as early as 1790 to a recent conversation with a descendant of Mercy Brown, Bell investigates twenty cases in which the vampiric dead were exhumed to save the ailing living. He also explores a widespread folk tradition that has survived generations, as ordinary people today strive to battle extraordinary diseases like Ebola or AIDS with a deeply rooted belief in their power to heal themselves. "Bell's absorbing account is ... a major contribution to the study of New England folk beliefs."&#x2014;Boston Globe "Filled with ghostly tales, glowing corpses, rearranged bones, visits to hidden graveyards.... This is a marvelous book."&#x2014;Providence Journal</p><p>MICHAEL E. BELL was the consulting folklorist at the Rhode Island Historical Preservation &amp; Heritage Commission in Providence. He has served as a scholar or consultant on numerous projects for the media, particularly those concerned with folklore, folk art, oral history, and humanities programs for young adults. He splits his time between Pawtuxet Village, Rhode Island and McKinney, Texas.The "vampire" threat here has little in common with your garden-variety Dracula, the fanged menace of Transylvania; these quiet apparitions are in some ways more macabre. In historical New England, consumption claimed thousands of lives. When several family members fell in quick succession, some suspected interference from the grave the "dead" extending their own lives by claiming those of others. Corpses were disinterred. Hearts were extracted and, if found to contain "living," or fresh, blood, subjected to an elaborate cremation and exorcism. Bell, a folklorist, pursues this grisly tradition one that still survives in legend throughout the Eastern seaboard and records his observations here. Despite tantalizing chapter headings ("I am Waiting and Watching for You," "Ghoulish, Wolfish Shapes"), Bell strives laudably for responsible scholarship, and the book is as much a critique of myth transmission as it is a tale of one man's vampire hunt. He goes to great lengths to forestall and undo exaggerations of his findings, advocating a very qualified and moderate use of the word "vampire" and transcribing oral interviews so painstakingly they can be difficult to read. But Bell himself is a talented stylist, and academics working in folklore and myth will find his study a refreshing departure from the dry fieldwork ordinarily on offer. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Shattered Justice (Family Honor Series #1)</h2><p>Deputy&#x2019;s Sense of Justice Destroyed <br><br>There&#x2019;s no way sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Dan Justice could have prepared for this.

His Psychopathia Sexualis (1886), a pioneering collection of 237 case studies in sexual pathology, revolutionized the scientific understanding of sex, influencing Freud (a student of Krafft-Ebing&#x2019;s) and introducing the terms sadism, masochism, and fetishism.</i><br><br><i>In this excerpt, Case 129 is presented and is the autobiography of a patient who &#x201c;feels like a woman in a man&#x2019;s form.&#x201d;</i><br><br>CASE 129.<i> Autobiography</i>. Born in Hungary in 1844, for many years I was the only child of my parents; for the other children died for the most part of general weakness. A brother of later birth is still living.<br><br>I come of a family in which nervous and mental diseases have been numerous. It is said that I was very pretty as a little child, with blond locks and transparent skin; very obedient, quiet and modest, so that I was taken everywhere in the society of ladies without any offense on my part.<br><br>With a very active imagination&#x2014;my enemy through life&#x2014;my talents developed rapidly. I could read and write at the age of four; my memory reaches back to my third year. I played with everything that fell into my hands&#x2014;with leaden soldiers, or stones, or ribbons from a toy shop; but a machine for working in wood, that was given to me as a present, I did not like. I liked best to be at home with my mother, who was everything to me. I had two or three friends with whom I got on good-naturedly; but I liked to play with her sisters quite as well, who always treated me like a girl, which at first did not embarrass me. I must have already been on the road to become just like a girl; at least, I can still well remember how it was always said: &#x201c;He is not intended for a boy.&#x201d; At this I tried to play the boy&#x2014;imitated my companions in everything, and tried to surpass them in wildness. In this I succeeded. There was no tree or building too high for me to reach its top. I took great delight in soldiers. I avoided girls more, because I did not wish to play with their playthings; and it always annoyed me that they treated me so much like one of themselves.<br><br>In the society of mature people, however, I was always modest, and, also, always regarded with favor. Fantastic dreams about wild animals&#x2014;which once drove me out of bed without waking me&#x2014;frequently troubled me. I was always very simply but very elegantly dressed, and thus developed a taste for beautiful clothing. It seems peculiar to me that, from the time of my school days, I had a partiality for ladies&#x2019; gloves, which I put on secretly as often as I could. Thus, when once my mother was about to give away a pair of gloves, I made great opposition to it, and told her, when she asked why I acted so, that I wanted them myself. I was laughed at; and from that time I took good care not to display my preference for female things. Yet my delight in them was very great. I took special pleasure in masquerade costumes&#x2014;i.e., only in female attire. If I saw them, I envied their owners. What seemed to me the prettiest sight was two young men, beautifully dressed as white ladies, with masks on; and yet I would not have shown myself to others as a girl for anything; I was so afraid of being ridiculed. At school I worked very hard, and was always among the first. From childhood my parents taught me that duty came first; and they always set me an example. It was also a pleasure for me to attend school; for the teachers were kind, and the elder pupils did not plague the younger ones. We left my first home; for my father was compelled, on account of his business&#x2014;which was dear to him&#x2014;to separate from his family for a year. We moved to Germany. Here there was a stricter, rougher manner, partly in teachers and partly in pupils; and I was again ridiculed on account of my girlishness. My schoolmates went so far as to give a girl, who had exactly my features, my name, and me hers; so that I hated the girl. But I later came to be on terms of friendship with her after her marriage. My mother tried to dress me elegantly; but this was repugnant to me, because it made me the object of taunting. So, finally, I was delighted when I had correct trousers and coats. But with these came a new annoyance. They irritated my genitals, particularly when the cloth was rough; and the touch of tailors while measuring me, on account of their tickling, which almost convulsed me, was unendurable, particularly about the genitals. Then I had to practice gymnastics; and I simply could do nothing at all, or only indifferently the things that even girls can do easily. While bathing I was troubled by feeling ashamed to undress; but I liked to bathe. Until my twelfth year I had a great weakness in my back. I learned to swim late, but ultimately so well that I took long swims. At thirteen I had pubic hair, and was about six feet tall; but my face was feminine until my eighteenth year, when my beard came in abundance and gave me rest from resemblance to woman. An inguinal hernia that was acquired in my twelfth year, and cured when I was twenty, gave me much trouble, particularly in gymnastics. Besides, from my twelfth year on, I had, after sitting long, and particularly while working at night, an itching, burning and twitching, extending from the penis to my back, which the acts of sitting and standing increased, and which was made worse by catching cold. But I had no suspicion whatever that this could be connected with the genitals. Since none of my friends suffered in this way, it seemed strange to me; and it required the greatest patience to endure it, the more owing to the fact that my abdomen troubled me.<br><br>In<i> sexualibus</i> I was still perfectly innocent; but now, as at the age of twelve or thirteen, I had a definite feeling of preferring to be a young lady. A young lady&#x2019;s form was more pleasing to me; her quiet manner, her deportment, but particularly her attire, attracted me. But I was careful not to allow this to be noticed; and yet I am sure that I should not have shrunk from the castration knife, could I have thus attained my desire. If I had been asked to say why I preferred female attire, I could have said nothing more than that it attracted me powerfully; perhaps, also, I seemed to myself, on account of my uncommonly white skin, more like a girl. The skin of my face and hands, particularly, was very sensitive. Girls liked my society; and, though I should have preferred to have been with them constantly, I avoided them when I could; for I had to exaggerate in order not to appear feminine. In my heart I always envied them. I was particularly envious when one of my young girlfriends got long dresses and wore gloves and veils. When, at the age of fifteen, I was on a journey, a young lady, with whom I was boarding, proposed that I should mask as a lady and go out with her; but, owing to the fact that she was not alone, I did not acquiesce, much as I should have liked it. While on this journey, I was pleased at seeing boys in one city wearing blouses with short sleeves, and the arms bare. A lady elaborately dressed was like a goddess to me; and if even her hand touched me coldly I was happy and envious, and only too gladly would have put myself in her place in the beautiful garments and lovely form. Nevertheless, I studied assiduously, and passed through the Realschule and the gymnasium in nine years, passing a good final examination. I remember, when fifteen, having first expressed to a friend the wish to be a girl. In answer to his question, I could not give the reason why. At seventeen I got into fast society; I drank beer, smoked, and tried to joke with waiter girls. The latter liked my society, but they always treated me as if I wore petticoats. I could not take dancing lessons, they repelled me so; but if I could have gone as a mask, it would have been different. My friends loved me dearly; I hated only one, who seduced me into onanism. Shame on those days, which injured me for life! I practiced it quite frequently, but in it seemed to myself like a double man. I cannot describe the feeling; I think it was masculine, but mixed with feminine elements. I could not approach girls; I feared them, but they were not strange to me. They impressed me as being more like myself; I envied them. I would have denied myself all pleasures if, after my classes, at home I could have been a girl and thus have gone out. Crinoline and a smoothly fitting glove were my ideals. With every lady&#x2019;s gown I saw I fancied how I should feel in it&#x2014;i.e., as a lady. I had no inclination toward men. But I remember that I was somewhat lovingly attached to a very handsome friend with a girl&#x2019;s face and dark hair, though I think I had no other wish than that we both might be girls.<br><br>At the high school I finally once had coitus; <i>hoc modo sensi, me libentius sub puella concubuisse et penem meum cum cunno mutatum maluisse</i>. To her astonishment, the girl had to treat me as a girl, and did it willingly; but she treated me as if I were she (she was still quite inexperienced, and, therefore, did not laugh at me).<br><br>When a student at times I was wild, but I always felt that I assumed this wildness as a mask. I drank and dueled, but I could not take lessons in dancing, because I was afraid of betraying myself. My friendships were close, but without other thoughts. It pleased me most to have a friend masked as a lady, or to study the ladies&#x2019; costumes at a ball. I understood such things perfectly. Gradually I began to feel like a girl.<br><br>On account of unhappy circumstances, I twice attempted suicide. Without any cause I once did not sleep for fourteen days, had many hallucinations (visual and auditory at the same time), and was with both the living and the dead. The latter habit of thought remains. I also had a friend (a lady) who knew my hobby and put on my gloves for me; but she always looked upon me as a girl. Thus I understood women better than other men did, and in what they differed from men; so I was always treated<i> more feminarium</i>&#x2014;as if they had found in me a female friend. On the whole, I could not endure obscenity, and indulged in it myself only out of braggadocio when it was necessary. I soon overcame my aversion to foul odors and blood, and even liked them. Only some things I could not look at without nausea. I was wanting in only one respect: I could not understand my own condition. I knew that I had feminine inclinations, but believed that I was a man. Yet I doubt whether, with the exception of the attempts at coitus, which never gave me pleasure (which I ascribe to onanism), I ever admired a woman without wishing I were she; or without asking myself whether I should not like to be the woman, or be in her attire. Obstetrics I learned with difficulty (I was ashamed for the exposed girls, and had a feeling of pity for them); and even now I have to overcome a feeling of fright in obstetrical cases; indeed, it has happened that I thought I felt the traction myself. After filling several positions successfully as a physician, I went through a military campaign as a volunteer surgeon. Riding, which, while a student, was painful to me, because in it the genitals had more of a feminine feeling, was difficult for me (it would have been easier in the female style).<br><br>Still, I always thought I was a man with obscure masculine feeling; and whenever I associated with ladies, I was still soon treated as an inexperienced lady. When I wore a uniform for the first time, I should have much preferred to have slipped into a lady&#x2019;s costume, with a veil; I was disturbed when the stately uniform attracted attention. In private practice I was successful in the three principal branches. Then I made another military campaign; and during this I came to understand my nature; for I think that, since the first ass ever made, no beast of burden has ever had to endure with so much patience as I have. Decorations were not wanting, but I was indifferent to them.<br><br>Thus I went through life, such as it was, never satisfied with myself, full of dissatisfaction with the world, and vacillating between sentimentality and a wildness that was for the most part affected.<br><br>My experience as a candidate for matrimony was very peculiar. I should have preferred not to marry, but family circumstances and practice forced me to it. I married an energetic, amiable lady, of a family in which female government was rampant. I was in love with her as much as one of us can be in love&#x2014;i.e., what we love we love with our whole hearts, and live in it, even though we do not show it as much as a genuine man does. We love our brides with all the love of a woman, almost as a woman might love her bridegroom. But I cannot say this for myself; for I still believed that I was but a depressed man, who would come to himself, and find himself out by marriage. But, even on my marriage night, I felt that I was only a woman in man&#x2019;s form; <i>sub femina locum meum esse mihi visum est</i>. On the whole, we lived contented and happy, and for two years were childless. After a difficult pregnancy, during which time I lay at the point of death in the enemy&#x2019;s own country, my wife gave birth to our first boy in a difficult labor&#x2014;a boy still afflicted with a melancholy nature. Then came a second, who is very quiet; a third, full of peculiarities; a fourth, a fifth; and all have the predisposition to neurasthenia. Since I always felt out of my own place, I went much in gay society; but I always worked as much as human strength would endure. I studied and operated; and I experimented with many drugs and methods of cure, always on myself. I left the regulation of the house to my wife, as she understood housekeeping very well. My marital duties I performed as well as I could, but without personal satisfaction. Since the first coitus, the masculine position in it has been repugnant, and also difficult for me. I should have much preferred to have the other <i>r�le</i>.</p><h2>Alter Egos: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Twilight Struggle Over American Power</h2><p><b>The deeply reported story of two supremely ambitious figures, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&#x2014;archrivals who became partners for a time, trailblazers who share a common sense of their historic destiny but hold very different beliefs about how to project American power</b><br><br> In <i>Alter Egos</i>, veteran <i>New York Times </i>White House correspondent Mark Landler takes us inside the fraught and fascinating relationship between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&#x2014;a relationship that has framed the nation&#x2019;s great debates over war and peace for the past eight years.<br><br>In the annals of American statecraft, theirs was a most unlikely alliance. Clinton, daughter of an anticommunist father, was raised in the Republican suburbs of Chicago in the aftermath of World War II, nourishing an unshakable belief in the United States as a force for good in distant lands. Obama, an itinerant child of the 1970s, was raised by a single mother in Indonesia and Hawaii, suspended between worlds and a witness to the less savory side of Uncle Sam&#x2019;s influence abroad. Clinton and Obama would later come to embody competing visions of America&#x2019;s role in the world: his, restrained, inward-looking, painfully aware of limits; hers, hard-edged, pragmatic, unabashedly old-fashioned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spanning the arc of Obama&#x2019;s two terms,&nbsp;<i>Alter Egos</i>&nbsp;goes beyond the speeches and press conferences to the Oval Office huddles and South Lawn strolls, where Obama and Clinton pressed their views. It follows their evolution from bitter rivals to wary partners, and then to something resembling rivals again, as Clinton defined herself anew and distanced herself from her old boss. In the process, it counters the narrative that, during her years as secretary of state, there was no daylight between them, that the wounds of the 2008 campaign had been entirely healed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The president and his chief diplomat parted company over some of the biggest issues of the day: how quickly to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; whether to arm the rebels in Syria; how to respond to the upheaval in Egypt; and whether to trust the Russians. In Landler&#x2019;s gripping account, we venture inside the Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s compound, watch Obama and Clinton work in tandem to salvage a conference on climate change in Copenhagen, and uncover the secret history of their nuclear diplomacy with Iran&#x2014;a story with a host of fresh disclosures.<br><br> With the grand sweep of history and the pointillist detail of an account based on insider access&#x2014;the book draws on exclusive interviews with more than one hundred senior administration officials, foreign diplomats, and friends of Obama and Clinton&#x2014;Mark Landler offers the definitive account of a complex, profoundly important relationship. As Barack Obama prepares to relinquish the presidency, and Hillary Clinton makes perhaps her last bid for it, how both regard American power is a central question of our time.<br><br> <b>Advance praise for <i>Alter Egos</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A superb journalist has brought us a vivid, page-turning, and revelatory account of the relationship between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as of their statecraft. <i>Alter Egos</i>&nbsp;will make a signal contribution to the national debate over who should be the next American president.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Michael Beschloss, bestselling author of <i>Presidential Courage</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mark Landler, one of the best reporters working in Washington today, delivers an inside account of Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s relationship with Barack Obama that brims with insight and high-level intrigue.

In twenty-four years at the<i> Times,</i> Landler has been the newspaper&#x2019;s bureau chief in Hong Kong and Frankfurt, European economic correspondent, and a business reporter in New York. He lives with his family in Chevy Chase, Maryland.Prologue<br><br> The Warrior and the Priest<br><br> Barack Obama turned up unexpectedly in the press cabin of Air Force One as the plane was high above the South China Sea, about to begin its descent into Malaysia on a flight from South Korea. The president was not one for casual in--flight visits, saving these encounters for the trip home to Washington, when he would ruminate with reporters, off the record, about what he had accomplished overseas. So when he appeared on the afternoon of April 26, 2014, in the middle of a weeklong tour of Asia, something clearly was up. Wearing an open--necked blue shirt, gray slacks, and an unsmiling expression, Obama shook hands with the journalists on board that day: reporters from the four major news agencies; a network producer from CBS News; a correspondent for the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> Before he reached the third row of seats, where I was standing with a hand outstretched, the president wheeled around, returned to the front of the cabin, and propped himself, arms crossed, against a gray bulkhead, next to a flickering television screen.<br> It was hard to know if Obama had ignored me intentionally: I was the last in a scrum of reporters, and the president likes to keep these pleasantries to a minimum anyway. But when he swatted away my opening question about China, a chill wind was clearly blowing.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll answer that in a minute,&#x201d; the president said, &#x201c;but first I want to say a few things.&#x201d;<br> Obama, it turned out, was angry about two articles that had run in <i>The New York Times</i> the previous day. One, by me and a colleague, Jodi Rudoren, declared that his trip had already been marred by a pair of setbacks: the failure to strike a trade deal with Japan and the collapse of his latest effort to negotiate a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. The other said his administration had underestimated the bellicose nature of North Korea&#x2019;s new ruler, Kim Jong--un. Obama wanted me to know he never expected to sign a trade agreement on that trip, nor, for that matter, did he bear any illusions about North Korea&#x2019;s boy dictator. The impromptu visit was meant to set the press straight about our coverage of his foreign policy. Obama viewed it as shallow, mistaking prudence for fecklessness, pragmatism for lack of ambition.<br> &#x201c;Ben and I have been talking about giving a speech that lays out my foreign policy,&#x201d; he said, stealing a glance at his foreign policy amanuensis, Benjamin Rhodes, who had slipped quietly into a seat behind the reporters, next to the press secretary, Jay Carney, and seemed as unsure of what his boss was going to say as the reporters were.<br> &#x201c;I can sum up my foreign policy in one phrase,&#x201d; Obama said, pausing a beat for his punch line. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do stupid shit.&#x201d;<br> America&#x2019;s problems, he said, stemmed not from doing too little but too much, from overreach rather than inaction. The country&#x2019;s greatest disasters had come from blundering into reckless military adventures, whether in Vietnam or Iraq. The key to managing a sound foreign policy was to avoid entanglements in places where America&#x2019;s national interests were not directly at stake&#x2014;-Syria, for example, which was caught up in a sectarian war that would defy outside efforts to end it; or Ukraine, victimized by a predatory Russia but a country with which the United States conducted a negligible amount of trade. Warming to his theme, Obama offered a brisk tour of places his White House had <i>not</i> started new conflicts: the Middle East, Asia, eastern Europe. Historic achievements in foreign policy&#x2014;-Nixon&#x2019;s opening to China&#x2014;-were once--in--a--generation occurrences, he said. He might yet get one if the West negotiated an agreement with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. But in a world of unending strife and unreliable despotic leaders, hoping for more than that was simply not realistic. In such a world, Obama was content to hit singles and doubles, hewing to his foreign policy version of the Hippocratic oath.<br> As we touched down outside Malaysia&#x2019;s capital, Kuala Lumpur, Obama kept talking, bracing himself against the bulkhead as the tires squealed and ordering those who were standing in the aisle to sit down. (&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only one who&#x2019;s allowed to stand,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want that liability.&#x201d;) Before returning to his cabin, where he would put on a jacket and tie and jog down the stairs to another red--carpet welcome in another distant land, Obama turned to the reporters and asked, &#x201c;Now what&#x2019;s my foreign policy philosophy?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do stupid shit,&#x201d; we replied sheepishly, like schoolchildren taught a naughty rhyme by a subversive teacher.<br> Obama smiled and then was gone as abruptly as he had come. His credo hung in the air, though. At one level, it seemed crude, almost juvenile, particularly coming from a man who cared deeply about words and believed in the power of language to convey ideas. And yet it had the ring of authenticity. More so than his shimmering oratory&#x2014;-his references to the &#x201c;arc of history&#x201d; or the &#x201c;spark of the divine&#x201d;&#x2014;-those four words seemed to capture what was for Obama the irreducible truth of being commander in chief of the world&#x2019;s remaining superpower.<br> As a White House correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i>, I had traveled to a dozen countries with the president over four years, from a state visit to Buckingham Palace, arriving in a thirty--car motorcade, to a secret mission in Afghanistan, flying at night over the Hindu Kush in Black Hawk helicopters. I questioned him at news conferences in the East Room and the Great Hall of the People, listened to him elaborate his worldview in speeches in London, Jerusalem, and Brisbane. And yet it was during a salty Saturday afternoon encounter in the back of Air Force One that Obama uttered what would become perhaps the signature slogan of his presidency&#x2014;-the foreign policy equivalent of &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the economy, stupid.&#x201d;<br> Soon enough, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do stupid shit&#x201d; entered the vernacular. Obama repeated it in a meeting with columnists and editorial writers; his advisers cited it in interviews; it was even codified in a speech he gave the following month at the United States Military Academy at West Point&#x2014;-an address that will surely rank as one of the most ambivalent ever delivered by an American president. The elders of the foreign policy establishment debated the wisdom and meaning of the phrase, usually amending it, in a clumsy attempt to make it more family friendly, to &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do stupid stuff.&#x201d; To Obama&#x2019;s critics, it became shorthand for the president&#x2019;s weak and dilatory leadership&#x2014;-leadership, they said, that had relinquished America&#x2019;s historic and necessary role as the ultimate guarantor of world order. It seemed, in the wake of the Islamic State&#x2019;s brutal rampage across Syria and Iraq and Russia&#x2019;s de facto invasion of Ukraine, hopelessly inadequate to a storm--tossed world.<br> Among those critics was Hillary Clinton, his onetime rival who had become his loyal lieutenant and now aspired to be his successor. As secretary of state, she had been intimately involved in every major foreign policy debate of his presidency. She would run for the White House, in no small measure, as the custodian of his legacy. And yet, once Clinton had left his cabinet at the end of the first term, she was eager to start delineating her own views about the world. It was an inevitable distancing of herself from her former boss, and like all such partings, it wasn&#x2019;t pretty.<br> &#x201c;Great nations need organizing principles,&#x201d; she said when she was asked in the summer of 2014 if Obama&#x2019;s phrase held any lessons for her. &#x201c; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do stupid stuff&#x2019; is not an organizing prin-ciple.&#x201d;<br> Dissent was not something I encountered in two years of covering Clinton at the State Department (I moved to the White House beat in 2011). She was robotically faithful and on message in those days, apt to start sentences with &#x201c;As President Obama said&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; or &#x201c;President Obama has been very clear&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; She told off aides who criticized him or his policies, a courtesy the White House didn&#x2019;t reciprocate. Loyal, disciplined, and determined to be a team player, Clinton rarely, if ever, showed public daylight between her and the president. For reporters who expected the kind of withering sniper fire between Foggy Bottom and the Oval Office that Clinton and Obama had exchanged in South Carolina during the 2008 primaries, their display of unity was stifling.<br> To travel with the secretary of state as I did, to forty--three countries on four continents, however, was to witness a woman completing a remarkable, decade--long metamorphosis&#x2014;-one that widened, rather than narrowed, her differences with the progressive president she had agreed to serve. Clinton was shedding the last vestiges of her image as a polarizing, left--wing social engineer in favor of a new role as commanding figure on the global stage, someone who could go toe--to--toe with the mullahs in Tehran or the cold warriors in Moscow. A loyal lieutenant, yes, but a general in waiting.<br> Under the surface, Clinton&#x2019;s Manichean worldview was always there. It turned up early, in her blunt closed--door prediction to an Arab foreign minister that the Iranians would spurn Obama&#x2019;s offer of an olive branch. Later, one could see it in her unstinting support of the military commanders in their request for a larger American troop deployment to Afghanistan than the president or even his Republican defense secretary wanted. Or in her support of the Pentagon&#x2019;s recommendation to leave a residual force of 10,000 to 20,000 troops behind in Iraq. It surfaced in her campaign for air strikes in Libya to prevent a slaughter by Colonel Muammar al--Qaddafi, and it fueled her case, the summer before she left the State Department, for funneling weapons to the rebels fighting Bashar al--Assad in Syria.<br> Avidly, if discreetly, Clinton played the house hawk in Obama&#x2019;s war cabinet.<br> That Clinton is much more hawkish than Obama is no revelation to anyone who watched them brawl in the winter of 2008. She accused her young opponent of na�vet� after he said he would negotiate with America&#x2019;s adversaries &#x201c;without preconditions.&#x201d; She warned Iran that if it ever launched a nuclear strike on Israel, &nbsp;the United States would &#x201c;totally obliterate&#x201d; it. Their differences, however, were largely submerged by Clinton&#x2019;s innate caution, relentless self--control, and the common cause the two rivals made when she agreed to join Obama&#x2019;s cabinet. He recruited her to repair an American image that had been shredded after eight years of George W. Bush&#x2019;s presidency. She, with her dreams of the White House deferred, recognized this as a way to burnish her national security credentials and keep her place on the world stage. The last thing Clinton wanted was a public rift with her new boss.<br> Once she was a private citizen, however, with the presidency again in her sights, the fissures between them became harder to conceal. Nor was she as inclined to do so. She came out against his ambitious Asia-Pacific trade pact, after having been one of its most enthusiastic advocates. She began to etch clear policy differences with him on Syria and Russia&#x2014;-a distancing his aides found opportunistic, if unsurprising. In August 2014, Clinton said Obama&#x2019;s refusal to arm the rebels in Syria left a security vacuum there and in Iraq, which had been filled by the brutal warriors of the Islamic State. Her criticism antagonized a president who already felt embattled. A few days later, the pair hugged in an awkward reconciliation at a birthday party in Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard for Vernon Jordan&#x2019;s wife, Ann. &#x201c;I never saw them interact all evening,&#x201d; said a guest who watched their stilted body language from a nearby table.<br> Clinton still embraced central tenets of Obama&#x2019;s foreign policy; it was, after all, her foreign policy, too. In the fall of 2015, she articulated the case for his much--disputed nuclear agreement with Tehran to an audience at the Brookings Institution. But their public remarks only underscored how differently Clinton viewed the achievement than Obama. He called it &#x201c;the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated.&#x201d; She called it a flawed deal worth supporting only if it was linked to relentless enforcement, a concerted effort to thwart Iranian malfeasance in the Middle East, and an unwavering threat to use military force to prevent Iran from ever getting a bomb. &#x201c;My starting point will be one of distrust,&#x201d; she said.<br> Clinton&#x2019;s break with Obama over Russia played out similarly. She had long been more suspicious of Vladimir Putin than the president, though she voiced those warnings, Obama&#x2019;s aides noted, only when Putin&#x2019;s sinister motives were already well established. At a Democratic fundraiser in California in March 2014, she likened his annexation of Crimea to Hitler&#x2019;s conquest of the Sudetenland in the 1930s. Eighteen months later, she said Obama&#x2019;s restrained response to Putin&#x2019;s bullying of Ukraine was inadequate. And when Putin intervened in Syria on behalf of Assad, Clinton sounded the trumpet of a new cold war. &#x201c;All the Russian experts that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials,&#x201d; she said. These retired cold warriors, she said, needed to draw up a battle plan for &#x201c;how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond.&#x201d;<br> Their differences surfaced again during the bloody months at the end of 2015, when radical Islamists carried out killing sprees in Paris and California. The carnage propelled terrorism to the forefront of yet another presidential campaign. Suddenly, the tangled conflict in the Levant was no longer just a riddle for foreign policy experts; it posed a direct threat to the homeland, throwing Obama on his back foot and playing out in the crude appeals to nativism and nationalism by the Republican candidates. Syria was where Clinton had first split with him over supplying arms to the rebels; now they split again over her call to impose a no--fly zone over northern Syria, as her husband had done in Iraq in the 1990s to protect the Kurds.<br> &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations a few days after the attacks in Paris, &#x201c;I have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do.&#x201d;<br><br> ���<br><br> Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are more than just two of the most riveting political figures of our time. They are protagonists in a great debate over American power&#x2014;-one that will decide not only who sits in the Oval Office but the direction she or he will take a nation that faces a new twilight struggle against the forces of disorder.<br> On one side of the debate stand those, like Obama, who believe the United States resorts too readily to military force to defend its interests, that American intervention in other countries usually ends in misery, and that the nation would be well--served by defining its interests more narrowly than it has for most of the post&#x2013;-World War II era. On the other side stand those, like Clinton, who believe that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm, and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as George W. Bush once declared, into &#x201c;any dark corner of the world.&#x201d; Clinton and Obama have come to embody competing visions of America&#x2019;s role in the world: his vision restr...</p><h2>Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System (Special 65)</h2><p>Another Interurbans Special classic: this one covers the entire life of the train and ferry system that once connected San Francisco, Oakland and Alameda. The book covers much more than simply the Southern Pacific trains -- it begins in 1851 when the first suggestion was made to connect Contra Costa to San Francisco and continues systematically through the years as various ferry systems were opened and train systems were built, providing detailed information on every aspect (including fires, earthquakes, and wrecks), the transition from narrow to broad gauge, the transition from steam to electric, the connections between trains and ferries, the building of the Bay Bridge and the engineering genius that carried the trains across, and finally, the end of the trains and their disposition. Illustrated throughout with wonderful black and white photos, maps, schematic diagrams of the cars, and drawings of the repair shops, terminals, and piers. Includes numerous charts and tables with everything from timetables to the names of the ferry captains. 351 pages with index.</p><p></p><h2>George Washington, an American Icon: The Eighteenth-Century Graphic Portraits</h2><p>The catalogue of a exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery for the 250th anniversary of George Washington&#39;s birth. 101 portraits of Washington are described and illustrated. 45 figures accompany the text.</p><p></p><h2>The little German Cookbook</h2><p>Used Book</p><p></p><h2>Driven Patriot: The Life and Times of James Forrestal (Bluejacket Books)</h2><p>A haunting portrait of one of the most fascinating and influential figures of the mid-twentieth century, this biography takes a penetrating look at James Forrestal's life and work. Brilliant, ambitious, glamorous, yet a perpetual outsider, Forrestal forged a career that took him from his working-class origins to the social and financial stratosphere of Wall Street, and from there to policy making in Washington. As secretary of the navy during World War II, he was the principal architect in transforming an obsolescent navy into the largest, most formidable naval force in history. After the war, as the nation's first secretary of defense, he played a major role in shaping the anti-Communist consensus that sustained the U.S. policy of containment during the Cold War. Despite his many achievements, Forrestal's life ended in tragedy with his suicide in 1949.<br><p>This absorbing study not only takes an understanding look at the many-sided man but presents an authoritative history of the great but troubled years of America's rise to world primacy. Winner of the 1992 Roosevelt Naval History Prize, the book enjoyed wide acclaim when first published and is now considered a definitive work.</p></p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettesAn unsparing profile of James Forrestal (1892-1949), Secretary of the Navy under Truman, by Hoopes (The Devil and John Foster Dulles, 1973, etc.) and Brinkley (History/Hofstra Univ.). This is a bold, strongly psychological investigation of a man who cut the ties that bind, made a spectacular success and a dangerous marriage (to Vogue writer Josephine Ogden), and took his own life after a dramatic breakdown. Born into a small-town lower- middle-class Irish Catholic family, Forrestal put his background quickly behind him upon entering Princeton--where he was voted ``Most Likely to Succeed'' before dropping out for obscure reasons shortly before graduation. Rather than return home, he took demeaning work for over a year before walking into the office of a Princeton Wall Street acquaintance. His classic Roaring Twenties career made him a millionaire: The authors' comparisons with Gatsby are not far-fetched. Controlled, polite, and mysterious, Forrestal was also respected and liked, an eligible and promiscuous bachelor member of the Wall Street elite, working with the legendary Clarence Dillon on epic deals that made financial history, accepted by old money as well as by celebrities like Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Gary Cooper. Meanwhile, his wife, ``Jo,'' turned out to be as stubborn and original as himself, and their open marriage (his womanizing never stopped) was stormy yet successful. Forrestal was a logical inductee to the coming WW II war effort; but while his Washington career eclipsed his Wall Street success, his workaholic life was coming apart. By the time he became Secretary of the Navy, the authors say, his denial of his wife's alcoholism and schizophrenia presaged an abrupt and irreversible collapse, triggered by his dismissal by Truman. A powerful biography--critical but sympathetic--of a driven man whose dark side permeates the narrative. (Thirty-six photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

I didn&#x2019;t feel up to it but decided to go to the post office anyway.

Part memoir and part polemic, an anatomy of important and dangerous ideas, and a <i>cri de coeur</i> lamenting the erosion of standard liberal values, Boyers&#x2019;s collection of essays is devoted to such subjects as tolerance, identity, privilege, appropriation, diversity, and ableism that have turned academic life into a minefield. Why, Robert Boyers asks, are a great many liberals, people who should know better, invested in the drawing up of enemies lists and driven by the conviction that on critical issues no dispute may be tolerated? In stories, anecdotes, and character profiles, a public intellectual and longtime professor takes on those in his own progressive cohort who labor in the grip of a poisonous and illiberal fundamentalism. The end result is a finely tuned work of cultural intervention from the front lines.</p><p>Robert Boyers is editor of&nbsp;<i>Salmagundi</i>, professor of English at Skidmore College, and director of the New York State Summer Writers Institute. He is the author of ten previous books and the editor of a dozen others. He writes often for such magazines as&nbsp;<i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>,<i> The New Republic</i>,<i> The Nation</i>,<i> Yale Review</i>, and<i> Granta</i>.&#x201c;A rousing call for speech on college campuses that is truly free, addressing uncomfortable issues while allowing room for dissent...Coming from a clearly liberal point of view, Boyers nonetheless courts controversy&#x2014;and is bound to get it&#x2014;with some of his tenets, such as the thought that identity politics as such evinces &#x2018;a fear of the uncertainties and hard choices that come with modernity and the need to think.&#x2019; A nuanced argument of interest to those who worry that nuanced arguments are no longer possible in quad or classroom.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> <br> &#x201c;Robert Boyers writes in the great tradition of Saul Bellow, Irving Howe and Susan Sontag: a powerfully persuasive, insightful and provocative prose that mixes erudition and first-hand reportage, combativeness and sympathy, moral vehemence and humor. From his vantage point as longtime editor of the preeminent journal&nbsp;<i>Salmagundi</i>, Boyers has been in close contact with every seismic shift in literary, intellectual, artistic and academic quarters in recent decades, and for those of us who may require guidance, here is our guide.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Joyce Carol Oates</b><br> <br> &#x201c;Robert Boyers&#x2019;s voice is a bracing one: courageous, unsparing, and nuanced to a rare degree. In this book, he patiently and wittily speaks sanity to the towering forces of cultural craziness, and he actually respects everyone&#x2014;well, nearly everyone&#x2014;whom he subjects to his rigorous critique. For anyone wondering how a person should be, <i>The Tyranny of Virtue </i>is an excellent example.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Mary Gaitskill</b><br> <br> &#x201c;This is a moment in which many robust voices claim attention for groups and causes that have been undervalued historically&#x2014;a splendid moment for a culture that, at its best, places great value on reform that tends toward justice. In our universities, the debates it encourages have sometimes become vitriolic and judgmental. Robert Boyers has given us a reminder of the complexity of the issues at stake and the urgency of preventing a humane impulse from being overwhelmed by passions unworthy of it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Marilynne Robinson</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Boyers has written a probing meditation on his experiences within the left-liberal cultural bubble, including his own college, where he has been a formidable presence for decades. He trenchantly challenges assumptions, slogans and nostrums of those excessively certain and proud of their &#x2018;wokeness.&#x2019; I found&nbsp;<i>The Tyranny of Virtue</i>&nbsp;to be instructive and inspiring.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Randall Kennedy</b>, <b>Michael Klein Professor of Law, Harvard University</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <br>&#x201c;This book offers a sustained argument against the virtue-signaling and apologetics that have become a major force in the arts and academic life. Boyers's assessment is all the more persuasive for the way it draws on his own long experience as a teacher, critic, and commentator on American culture.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;David Bromwich, Yale University</b><br> <br>&#x201c;<i>The Tyranny of Virtue</i>: think of virtue as an ideal, and yet also as a tyranny, and all that does not belong to that realm must cower and disappear. We live in a time when true virtue seems to have disappeared, and everything that is not virtuous has taken to wearing virtue as a cloak. Of course I might have begun by saying that I know of almost no one but Robert Boyers who can succinctly penetrate and dispose of this masquerade of a period we are living in. So much that is wrong and dark he reveals in extraordinarily limpid prose, showing us that what is out there will not be made right and clear without the courage to name the human mess we have made. The life of the academy should remain sacred, and this book makes a splendid case for it, for the proposition that virtue is permanently hinged to the ideal of truth&#x2014;that many-hued and illusive reality. The admirable and triumphant accomplishment of this work is that it adds to the ongoingness of our common enterprise. <i>The</i> <i>Tyranny of Virtue </i>is a wonderful book, and I shall always have it nearby.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Jamaica Kincaid</b><br> <br> &#x201c;For decades Robert Boyers has been a bracing voice of sanity amid the ideological fashions of left and right. <i>The Tyranny of Virtue </i>is vintage Boyers&#x2014;a brave and timely challenge to the suffocating moral orthodoxy that has come to envelop academic life and much of our broader public discourse as well.

The author begins with an explanation of the equipment and how to use it, and progresses to simple patterns and how to form grounds, edges and corners. She concludes with instructions for making complete and usable items. The drawings, patterns and prickings are clear and detailed and support the text which is ideal for the novice lacemaker. Gillian Dye has made several varieties of lace and now teaches and demonstrates the art of lacemaking to both children and adults, concentrating on traditional and contemporary bobbin lace.</p><p></p><h2>The Ordeal of Total War, 1939-1945</h2><p>Describes Europe&#39;s adaption to total war and varied reactions to German occupation, with an analysis of Hitler&#39;s plan to consolidate his conquests</p><p></p><h2>Nero: The Man Behind the Myth</h2><p>Stories of Nero&#39;s tyrannical reign began before his body was cold and have continued to circulate; the monster who dallied while Rome burned, the tyrant who murdered his wife and his mother and who threw Christians to the lions. But is this the true story? The author seeks to overturn this popular conception of Nero and rescue the man from the myth by revealing Nero as a liberator, who tried to democratize the state. His story is told from his birth into the Imperial family through his mother&#39;s remarriage to the new Emperor Claudius--whom she would eventually murder; his education by Seneca; his marriage; his enthronement as Emperor at age 16; his role as patron; his love affair with Poppea and the murders of his wife and mother; the increasing enmity towards him; the Great Fire of Rome and building of the Golden Palace; the killing of the Christians; the death of Poppea and Nero&#39;s growing instability; treason trials and suicide writs; rebellion in Gaul and Spain; and Nero&#39;s suicide.</p><p>This revisionist biography of Nero succeeds in smashing the myth of the monster who callously fiddled while Rome burned. Although Holland admits that Nero was definitely no saint, he cites credible evidence suggesting that he was certainly no less cruel than many of his more revered predecessors. In fact, the historical record suggests that Nero's legacy was tarnished by an entrenched aristocracy that resented many of his unorthodox Hellenistic and egalitarian policies. By placing this much maligned emperor firmly in the social and cultural context of ancient Rome, the author is able to defend his supposition that Nero's reputation has suffered at the hands of modern scholars influenced by the exaggerated, inconsistent, and inaccurate accounts of his life written 50 or more years after his death. A convincing reappraisal of one of the ancient world's most intriguing rulers. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now, in stories spanning two centuries, historian Leo Banks delves into the characters of myth and legend, while writer/naturalist Craig Childs explores contempory issues through sketches of the people who live and work in the West's most recognizable natural wonder. <p>Every chapter is illustrated with at least one black and white photograph -- some are seldom-seen historical photos, others picture personalities who live and work in the Canyon now. A 15-page Grand Canyon "family album" acquaints readers with some of the interesting people who have been drawn to the Canyon through the years -- from Douglas Fairbanks to Barry Goldwater to the Harvey Girls. </p><p>Other books have examined the Grand Canyon as a natural wonder.

This anthology, with its rich mix of original essays, historical texts, and excerpts from oral histories, celebrates the natural and human history of this region. Editor Howard Mansfield says that "the elusive feel of one place exists in that intersection of political and family history, landscape, destiny, expectations, weather and time."<br><br>Featuring contributions from such writers as Sy Montgomery, Ernest Hebert, Janisse Ray, Tom Wessels, Richard Ober, Jim Collins, and Jane Brox, Where the Mountain Stands Alone ranges from the formation of the region's distinctive landscape to the lives and customs of its first inhabitants, from the industrialization of the antebellum period to the collapse of both farms and mills, from the region's influence on writers and artists to the rewilding and repopulating of the twentieth century. It is a selective but richly suggestive overview of centuries of human interaction with a particular landscape. "That New Hampshire bluff," as Henry David Thoreau said of Monadnock, "will longest haunt our dreams."<br><br>The Monadnock Institute of Nature, Place and Culture at Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, New Hampshire, promotes the interdisciplinary study of place and of the connections between community and environment.</p><p>HOWARD MANSFIELD is author of The Bones of the Earth (2004), The Same Ax, Twice (UPNE, 2000), and In The Memory House (1993).

Her beautiful light-filled<br>paintings have been exhibited by some of Britain's leading art institutions.

Her lesson on water and skies, for example, contains dozens of mini-lessons on the transitory moods and colors of the sea, the clouds, and reflections in ponds. Whether dealing with portraits, landscapes, or creative interpretations of the styles of C?zanne or Van Gogh, Simmonds never fails to inspire.

A foreign journalist said recently that it is the only country in the world where the children behave like adults and the adults like children. There could be no better introduction to this topsy-turvy wonderland than this lavishly illustrated guide to all those weird offices that still exist--offices that in any other country would have been quietly and efficiently abolished ages ago. Here is the Chief Butler and Grand Carver of England (the Earl of Denbigh, by hereditary right), the High Almoner, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries (responsible for "knackt bals"--don't ask!), and the Herb Strewer at the Coronation. It is all undeniably arcane and faintly ridiculous, but the child in us all will find it a hugely entertaining splash of color and eccentricity in an increasingly drab and uniform global culture. These <i>Keepers of the Kingdom</i> are sure to disappear before too much longer. Enjoy them while you can. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><h2>Come from Away</h2><p>The author traces the history of his mother&#39;s family in Newfoundland, portraying the events of everyday life and relating major episodes in Newfoundland&#39;s past that had a profound effect on his family</p><p>David Macfarlane was born in Canada, in 1952, and was educated at the University of Toronto. A regular contributor to several magazines and one of Canada&#39;s leading journalists, he has won numerous national awards for his stories. He lives in Toronto with his wife and two children.Like the legendary stories his Newfoundland relatives told- -stories that flowed back and forth, picking up after interruptions--Macfarlane offers a book in which personal memoir, history, and reflection on war all come together in one memorable, luminous whole. Growing up in Canada, Macfarlane was soon aware of the great difference between his father's relations, who maintained silence ``with the same hospitable agility a graceful conversationalist uses to overcome it,'' and his mother's family from Newfoundland, who loved to talk ``in great looping circles.'' And it is these stories of the Goodyear family of Newfoundland, which Macfarlane recalls as he relates a family history, that are in many ways a history of Newfoundland itself. Until voting to join Canada in 1948, Newfoundland was Britain's oldest colony, and this decision, which the author's grandfather could never forgive, led to one of the great family stories, for the old man apparently once told the now-Queen, in Newfoundland on a visit, exactly what he thought. An integral part of Newfoundland, the Goodyears immigrated from the western coast of England in the early 18th century, living first in an isolated fishing village, then moving in 1908 to Grand Falls in the interior. Here, in this company town established to provide paper for one of Britain's great press-barons, they prospered, but, like so many loyal Newfoundlanders, the Goodyears were irrevocably affected by WW I. Two thirds of the Newfoundlanders who volunteered were either killed or wounded; the Goodyear family sent five sons, and only two returned. It is this war that resonates through Macfarland's story: the way in which the family and the island responded, and were then subsequently changed, describes a place and a people of fierce independence, courage and loyalty, who would never be quite the same again. A remarkable and beautifully written book in which the rich stuff of family and local history join together to entertain, to instruct, and to move deeply. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is the lynch pin of the British landscape.&#39; The oak is our most beloved and most common tree. It has roots that stretch back to all the old European cultures but Britain has more ancient oaks than all the other European countries put together. More than half the ancient oaks in the world are in Britain. Many of our ancestors - the Angles, the Saxons, the Norse - came to the British Isles in longships made of oak. For centuries the oak touched every part of a Briton&#39;s life - from cradle to coffin It was oak that made the &#39;wooden walls&#39; of Nelson&#39;s navy, and the navy that allowed Britain to rule the world. Even in the digital Apple age, the real oak has resonance - the word speaks of fortitude, antiquity, pastoralism.The Glorious Life of the Oak explores our long relationship with this iconic tree; it considers the life-cycle of the oak, the flora and fauna that depend on the oak, the oak as medicine, food and drink, where Britain&#39;s mightiest oaks can be found, and it tells of oak stories from folklore, myth and legend.</p><p></p><h2>Mosby, the Kennedy Center Cat</h2><p>The book is based on the true story of a wild cat that lived in the Kennedy Center in the 1970s.

In <i>The Sion Revelation,</i> Picknett and Prince reveal the story of the Priory, taking readers on a highly significant, disturbing, and even alarming ride through history into an intriguing world where a great many uncomfortable facts will have to be faced, both religious and political. <br> <br> Drawing on a wealth of astonishing evidence, they answer numerous questions that shroud this society, including: <br><br> <b>� Does the Priory actually exist or is the group's entire history an elaborate hoax? <br> � Was Leonardo da Vinci really one of the Priory's Grand Masters? <br> � What is the truth behind Pierre Plantard, the enigmatic French aristocrat who claimed to be a Priory Grand Master -- and who some claim was a Nazi sympathizer? <br> � Could the Priory be a front for other occult societies in Europe with religious or even political agendas?</b> <br><br> By carefully untangling centuries of obfuscation, rumor, and documented fact, <i>The Sion Revelation</i> unravels the great intricacies of this secret society and takes us on a historical journey that is as groundbreaking in its explanation as it is riveting in its telling.</p><p><b>Lynn Picknett</b> is a writer, researcher, and lecturer on historical and religious mysteries.

With Lynn Picknett, he is the author of <i>The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ</i> and <i>Turin Shroud: In Whose Image?</i> He lives in London, England.Introduction <p> When we presented our discovery of the secret symbolism in Leonardo da Vinci's paintings in our 1997 book, <i>The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ,</i> little did we realize that we were making a significant contribution to a remarkable phenomenon of the twenty-first century. Not only did our book directly inspire Dan Brown to weave his blockbuster <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> (2003) around the concept of da Vinci's love of hidden heresies and dangerous codes, but we were taken aback to realize that in doing so we had also assisted at the birth of a new, impassioned wave of interest in the truth about the origins of Christianity. </p> <p> A central part of Brown's fiction is the notion that there exists an age-old French society, the Priory of Sion, whose task it is to protect the sacred bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene -- the implications of which are truly shocking to those who remain true to the traditional teachings of the Church. The inevitable backlash against all the subjects raised in Brown's book has seen the Priory of Sion roundly trounced, dismissed once and for all as a straightforward hoax. </p> <p> However, we became increasingly dissatisfied with either extreme -- complete acceptance of everything claimed by or on behalf of the Priory or blanket dismissal -- for two reasons. While there is evidence that the Priory is a modern creation, rather than the ancient and venerable secret society it is supposed to be, there is considerably more to it than a simple hoax. As our continuing research has found, the Priory really is important, but for rather different reasons. </p> <p> This has given us the golden opportunity to present our ongoing investigation into the Priory of Sion. And unexpectedly, we found this work converging with other, quite independent, lines of research, specifically those that led to our 1999 book, <i>The Stargate Conspiracy,</i> which dealt with a little-known but extremely influential politico-occult movement known as <i>synarchy.</i> As we delved into it even deeper, we found ourselves unexpectedly back in the underground stream that also sweeps the Priory of Sion along. Even the research for our book on the "secret history" of the Second World War, <i>Friendly Fire: The Secret War Between the Allies</i> (coauthored with the late Stephen Prior, and Robert Brydon, 2004), became surprisingly relevant, as certain power struggles in wartime France provide an important backdrop to <i>The Sion Revelation.</i> </p> <p> The second reason for our writing this book is much wider in scope, and to us more important: those who defend the traditional religious views against Dan Brown's book argue that if they can prove the Priory of Sion is a hoax, then the deeper issues -- such as the reality of the "forbidden" gospels, the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and the centuries-long Church cover-up of such inconvenient evidence about the Christian religion -- can also be condemned and dismissed. This is utter nonsense. </p> <p> Whatever else can be said about Brown's book, it has brought some fundamental questions about spirituality and religion to a massive and even secular international audience and sparked off far-reaching debates. It has even been pointed out that it has revived on a grassroots level the same bitter debate that raged in the formative years of the Christian religion. The major split was between the two fundamentally different visions of the faith: the Gnostic view, in which the individual forges his or her own relationship with God and is therefore responsible for his or her own salvation, and the priest-led faction that became the Church -- in which the Church alone holds the keys of the Kingdom. It is a battle that the Church believed long won, but now the fissure lines are reopening as the floor is cleared for either a new, informed debate or a fight -- and all due to the unlikely influence of an airport thriller! </p> <p> Obviously, for some reason and in some mysterious way, Dan Brown has tapped into the prevailing zeitgeist, but this phenomenon can only exist because people have a deep inner <i>need</i> to excavate beneath the traditional religious certainties. But Brown is by no means its only popular manifestation. J. K. Rowling's young wizard Harry Potter scintillates with Gnostic daring, and -- as many commentators point out -- the movie series <i>The Matrix</i> draws directly on ancient Gnostic concepts, dressing them up as science fiction, with elements from the Priory of Sion's mythos also having pride of place. While <i>The Matrix's</i> sacred city of "Zion"/Sion is not unique to Priory lore, it is hard to find another source for the character called the Merovingian. </p> <p> The true story of the Priory is rather different from Brown's version, but it is highly significant, disturbing, and even alarming. And it carries us along into a dark and intriguing world where a great many other uncomfortable facts, both religious and political, will have to be faced. </p> <p> LYNN PICKNETT </p> <p> CLIVE PRINCE </p> <p> LONDON </p> <p> September 2005 </p> <p> </p> <p> Copyright � 2006 by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince</p></p><h2>Kosher Revolution: New Techniques and Great Recipes for Unlimited Kosher Cooking</h2><p>Thanks to the availability of sophisticated kosher ingredients and food-savvy kosher cookbooks, kosher cooks are able to cook any kosher recipe at home.

It is hoped that this book can provide a springboard into the world of color for the artist.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is one obvious drawback to it. This is that when it comes to the subtlety of reproducing color all of the colors shown here are printed, not painted. They are not the actual colors at all, but are reproduced by the four color printing process using only four ink colors. Modern printing technology and the skills of graphic reproduction have brought us very close to the reality of seeing real, pure pigment color on the printed page.</p></p><h2>Down and Out in the Great Depression: Letters From the Forgotten Man</h2><p>Letters written by ordinary citizens to President Roosevelt and other government officials depict the conditions of life in America during the Depression</p><p>"There's nothing more deeply moving than reading the words and thus hearing the voices of the actual survivors of hard times.

Taber is famous for its bumper crop of succulent corn. Every year the<br>small town hosts Cornfest to celebrate the harvest. The festivities include a carnival, outdoor concerts, a craft fair, and fireworks, plus 5k and 10k runs.<br><br>Five years ago my daughter Carrie decided she wanted to join the rest of the family on the run. Carrie is a marvelous ice skater, but she&#x2019;d never participated in a formal footrace before. I decided the fatherly thing to do was to let her run with me. In my younger days, my keen competitive instincts would have steered me clear of any impediment that might hinder my chances at a medal. But after undergoing decades of God&#x2019;s teaching me life&#x2019;s true priorities, having gained much wisdom in my middle age, and having put on fifty pounds since my university days, I decided to forgo any chance of finishing near the top. I offered to run with my little daughter.<br><br>Carrie, knowing her dad&#x2019;s competitive nature, demanded assurance that I wouldn&#x2019;t abandon her in the heat of the race. I promised her I was running only for enjoyment and it would be great fun to accompany<br>her&#x2014;regardless of where we placed. In fact, I said, anytime she wanted to stop running and start walking to catch her breath, I&#x2019;d happily comply. <br><br>The starting gun fired. My wife and two sons were among the &#x201c;keeners&#x201d; at the front of the pack, and they quickly disappeared from sight around the first bend.<br><br>As my daughter and I loped along at an easy pace on that beautiful morning, I joked with her and encouraged her. After only two blocks, Carrie wanted to slow to a walk. It seemed a little early for our first rest break, but I told her that was fine by me. Dozens of young people whizzed past us as we leisurely walked along enjoying the morning air.<br><br>After a few minutes I asked Carrie if she was ready to try running again. She was. But after only a few more blocks, she asked to walk again. No problem. Young adults were streaming by. Then middle-aged people began passing us. Some older women were overtaking us at a brisk walk.<br><br>I exhorted my weary daughter to dig a little deeper so we could push forward. We ran, but soon she was complaining that her side hurt. I reluctantly agreed to walk again. In this pattern, our &#x201c;race&#x201d; continued.<br>Then it happened. I heard them coming. I was surprised anyone was still behind us, but sure enough, a middle-aged woman pushing her elderly mother <i>in a wheelchair </i>serenely glided past, leaving us to eat<br>their dust.<br><br>That was too much. &#x201c;I will NOT lose to THEM!&#x201d; I wheezed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got my limits!&#x201d;<br><br>We staggered off at a trot. I could just make out the finish line on the horizon. My legs were aching. My breath was coming in short, painful gasps. But we were slowly gaining on the wheelchair.<br><br>Then Carrie, too, noticed the crowds cheering and waving at the finish line in the distance. Suddenly she underwent a metamorphosis. The hesitant little girl I&#x2019;d been tenderly coaxing throughout the race immediately found her second wind. She accelerated rapidly. The lights had come on. She was possessed. <br><br>Carrie torpedoed past the wheelchair, her eye on the prize.<br><br>I tried to keep up, but there were only fumes left in my tank. I made a heroic last effort, barely edging out the octogenarian and her daughter before crossing the tape. <br><br>Carrie waited for me at the finish line with a water bottle and a handful of fruit. She wasn&#x2019;t even winded.<br><br>Later that day, we were met with a huge surprise. At the awards ceremony, Carrie received a beautiful first-place medal for her age category. (They handed out oxygen masks for mine.) I&#x2019;m so glad Carrie grew dissatisfied with her performance, even though she had no idea a prize was waiting for her just around the corner.<br><br>Carrie has since won another medal, and as I write this, she&#x2019;s training for a 10k race coming up soon.<br><br>What&#x2019;s my point? My daughter always had the ability to be a medal-winning runner, but she&#x2019;d set the limit for herself far below her capacity. She might have been satisfied to remain there too, had I not finally urged her to push on to another level. <br><br>The Bible describes the Christian life as a race (1 Corinthians 9:24&#x2013;27; Philippians 3:12&#x2013;14; 2 Timothy 4:7). This Christian race is one in which every participant has an equal opportunity to be spectacularly<br>successful. It all depends on how much the person wants to succeed. <br><br>The apostle Paul claimed he ran life&#x2019;s race to win the prize (1 Corinthians 9:24). Unfortunately, many Christians set their sights far too low. They&#x2019;re satisfied to plod along in dreary, unrewarding spirituality, unwilling to pay the price for greater spiritual accomplishments. They may be comfortable, but they&#x2019;re not experiencing nearly as much as they could. They&#x2019;ve inadvertently chosen to limit their experience of God.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s another picture. God invites His people to a richer experience: &#x201c;Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know&#x201d; ( Jeremiah 33:3). Almighty, infinite, all-knowing God welcomes people to come to Him and to allow Him to reveal things from His heart and mind that would amaze them. Yet when was the last time you learned something brand-new from God that was &#x201c;great and mighty&#x201d;? Many Christians today receive this enormous invitation, and yet we rarely experience a fresh, dynamic encounter with God. It&#x2019;s not that the Lord isn&#x2019;t willing to reveal more exciting truths to us; we limit our own capacity to receive more from Him. <br><br>The problem is never with God. The obstacle is us. We&#x2019;re far too easily satisfied. We limit God in our lives. <br><br>God &#x201c;is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us&#x201d; (Ephesians 3:20). Have you seen Him do things in and through your life that absolutely amaze you in their magnitude? If you haven&#x2019;t, why is that? After all, the Bible says God wants you to experience this.<br><br>Again, the impediment is not God. The problem lies with us. We&#x2019;ve become too easily satisfied with spiritual mediocrity. Some of us have become so used to a powerless life that we&#x2019;ve come to think of it as normal for the Christian. It is not. God has more for us to experience and to do than we could imagine. We limit God&#x2019;s activity by our own choices. This book is for those whose spiritual lives suffer from self-imposed limits. Does that describe you? Have you grown complacent in your walk with God? Do you assume you&#x2019;ve already reached the pinnacle of what you&#x2019;re going to experience in your Christian life? Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather grow stronger in your faith, enjoy new victories, and reach higher levels in your walk with God?<br><br>Whatever unnecessary limits you&#x2019;ve accepted in your spiritual life, my prayer is that you&#x2019;ll determine to break through the barriers that keep you from reaching an entirely new level in your relationship with God. <br><br>It&#x2019;s time to unlimit God in our lives and to invite Him to do what He longs to do in and through us&#x2014;knowing that He&#x2019;s prepared to respond to whatever it is we seek from Him.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve had the tremendous privilege of traveling around the world and seeing God&#x2019;s kingdom expanding on six continents. I&#x2019;ve met incredible Christians and been in dynamic churches that are experiencing God<br>working through them in amazing ways. But I&#x2019;ve also sensed the spiritual lostness among teeming multitudes in Asia, in massive townships in Africa, in isolated villages on the Amazon, and among affluent, spiritually indifferent crowds of businesspeople in downtown districts of the world&#x2019;s major cities. <br><br>Clearly, despite all the modern church is doing to extend God&#x2019;s kingdom, it&#x2019;s not enough. We&#x2019;re losing ground. The number of unbelievers worldwide is growing faster than the numbers of believers.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve worshiped with fellow Christians from around the world as we praised God for His mighty power. Yet God&#x2019;s power seems to be in short supply in many churches today. Countless congregations are divided,<br>many others have reached a plateau or begun a steady decline&#x2014;yet they sing every Sunday of God&#x2019;s awesome strength.<br><br>Clearly the status quo of modern Christianity is inadequate. More of the same won&#x2019;t bring us any closer to God&#x2019;s rule on earth. As Christians today we must reach an entirely new plane in our walk with God.<br>Churches must believe and serve their Lord at a higher level than they&#x2019;ve experienced so far. There&#x2019;s too much at stake for Christians and churches to keep doing business as usual.<br><br>God is looking for people who are willing to pay the price to obtain a qualitatively different walk with Him. Will you be one of those people? Are you prepared to unlimit God in your life so you can experience<br>Him the way He has always wanted you to?</p><h2>I Can&#39;t Believe I Have to Do This (Novel)</h2><p>When Dean Matthews receives a journal as a twelfth birthday present, he has no idea what to write about, but that soon changes as his life becomes a roller-coaster ride with his trouble-making friend Aaron. Reprint.</p><p>Grade 5-8. What 12-year-old Dean Matthews can't believe he has to do is keep a journal, a task cheerfully imposed upon him?on his birthday, no less?by his mother, with a nonnegotiable, someday-you'll-thank-me pronouncement. Dean resists with every fiber of his adolescent being, but his mother insists. What follows is a vivid, first-person account of a pivotal year in a young boy's life. Most critically, Dean's relationship with his best friend, Aaron, begins to crumble as Aaron comes under the influence of a troubled, older boy. Drugs and alcohol complicate matters, and Aaron's downward spiral is swift and, possibly, irreversible. Peer pressure sucks Dean into the maelstrom, with serious consequences, but his values are solid, his support system strong, and he survives to marvel at all the year has brought. And, ultimately, to start a new journal on his own?warming the cockles of his mother's heart and of all who believe in the power of real family values. Though the use of alternating type fonts is puzzling, the journal format lends immediacy to the narrative and allows for speedy delineation of character and plot. Dean's mother is a bit too smug, even from an adult perspective; Aaron's descent into delinquency is much too sudden; and Dean's recognition of it a bit too slow. Nonetheless, readers should have no trouble relating to the narrator, identifying with him, even pulling back from the brink with him. Fluid writing and abundant action make this a good read; credible characters allow its important, if rather obvious message to succeed.?Marcia Hupp, Mamaroneck Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.A 12-year-old gets a tutorial in the consequences of irresponsible behavior and the dangers of bad company in this earnestly cautionary novel. At his mother's behest, Dean keeps a journal of what turns out to be a traumatic year, beginning with a parental interview after he threatens his tattletale little sister and ending with a community service sentence for joy-riding with a drunk, high, underage driver. In between, his bike is stolen and the family dog gets run over--both consequences of his own carelessness--he is caught lying and shoplifting, and he watches his best friend Aaron and a new buddy drink beer, act stupid, and throw up. Newcomer Alford takes on a catalog of other issues too, as topical as ear-piercing and as timeless as dealing with bullies. The journal entries are only a pretext, readily abandoned; Dean's comments generally take up no more than a few lines at the head or tail of each chapter, and are mostly of the whiny variety, while the real stories emerge in the paragraphs of first-person narration. It's not entirely a tale of woe: Dean wins a student council seat, has a first date, and gains more wholesome friends, but some readers will wilt under the barrage of lessons.

Now, struggling through the harsh winter aboveground, they find an unusual book. Torn up and missing most of its pages, it alludes to a mysterious device from before the Disaster, which they believe is still in Ember. Together, Lina and Doon must go back underground to retrieve what was lost and bring light to a dark world.<br><br>In the fourth Book of Ember, bestselling author Jeanne DuPrau juxtaposes yet another action-packed adventure with powerful themes about hope, learning, and the search for truth.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Jeanne DuPrau is the bestselling author of <i>The City of Ember, The People of Sparks, </i>and <i>The Prophet of Yonwood. </i>She lives in Menlo Park, California. Visit her Web site at www.jeanneduprau.com.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>In the village of Sparks, the day was ending. The pale winter sun had begun to sink behind a bank of clouds in the west, and shadows darkened the construction field behind the Pioneer Hotel, where workers labored in the gloom. Winter rains had turned the ground to a soup of mud. Stacks of lumber and piles of bricks and stones stood everywhere, along with buckets of nails, tools, old windows and doors, anything that might be useful for building houses. Though the daylight was almost gone, people worked on. They were trying to accomplish as much as possible, because they could see that a storm was coming.<br><br>But at last someone called, "Time to quit!" and the workers sighed with relief and began to pack up their tools. <br><br>One of the workers was a boy named Doon Harrow, thirteen years old, who had spent the day hauling loads of boards from one place to another and trying to measure and cut them to necessary lengths. When he heard the call, he set down the rusty old saw he'd been using and looked around for his father. The workers stumbling across the field were no more than shadowy figures now; it was hard to tell one from another. Ahead of them loomed the hotel, a few of its windows shining dimly with the light of candles lit by those too young or old or ill to be outside working. "Father!" Doon called. "Where are you?" <br><br>His father's voice answered from some distance behind him. "Right here, son. Coming! Wait for--" And then came a sound that made Doon whirl around: first a shattering crash, and then a shriek of a kind he'd never before heard from his mild-mannered father.<br><br>Doon ran, squelching through the mud. He found his father sprawled on the ground beside a broken windowpane that had been leaning against a pile of bricks. "What happened?" Doon cried. "Are you hurt?"<br><br>His father struggled to his knees. In a hoarse, strangled voice, he said, "Tripped. Fell on the glass. My hand."<br><br>Others had gathered now, and they helped him up. Doon took his father's arm. Enough light remained in the sky for him to see what had happened: the palm of his father's hand was sliced open, gushing blood. <br><br>One of the men standing nearby tore off his shirt and wrapped it around the wound. "Make a tight fist," the man said. <br><br>Doon's father curled his fingers, wincing. Blood stained the shirt. <br><br>"We have to get to the doctor," Doon said. <br><br>"Yes, that cut needs stitching up," said the man who'd given his shirt. "Go quick, and maybe you can make it to the village before it rains."<br><br>"Can you walk, Father?" Doon asked.<br><br>"Oh, yes," said his father in a weak voice. "Might need another . . ." He trailed off, holding out his hand, and Doon saw that the shirt wrapped around it was already soaked with blood. <br><br>"Ice would slow the bleeding," someone said. "But we don't have any." <br>A woman took off her scarf and passed it to Doon, and another man ripped strips of cloth from his shirt. Once the injured hand was wrapped in these, Doon and his father started across the field. <br><br>"You'll need a lantern!" cried a boy--one of Doon's friends, Chet Noam. "Go on ahead. I'll get one and catch up with you." <br><br>They walked as quickly as they could, but it seemed unlikely they'd avoid getting wet. A few raindrops were already drifting down. Doon felt their light, cold touch on his face. Rain had become familiar to him by now. Since he and his people had arrived here in Sparks from the city of Ember, where sun and rain alike were unknown, four rainstorms had swept over the land. The first had terrified the people of Ember, who thought something dreadful had gone wrong with the sky. <br>A voice called to them from behind, and Chet came running up. "Here," he said, handing Doon a lantern made of a can punched with holes and containing a burning candle. "And listen," he added. "A roamer has arrived, wanting shelter at the hotel. Tell people that if the rain stops, there'll be trading in the plaza tomorrow morning."<br><br>"All right," said Doon. He and his father turned again toward the town and hurried on. "Is the pain very bad?" Doon asked.<br><br>"Not too bad," said his father, whose face was unnaturally white. "It is bleeding a lot."<br><br>"Doctor Hester will know how to stop it," Doon said, though he wasn't sure of that. The doctor did the best she could, but there was a great deal she couldn't cure.<br><br>They passed a grove of trees thrashing in the wind. Behind the trees, a little distance off the road, a tall building loomed. A patch of blackness showed where a section of its roof had fallen in.<br><br>"They still haven't fixed it," said Doon as they went past, but his father didn't even look up.<br>The damaged building was called the Ark, the place where the people of Sparks stored their food supplies. The first rainstorm of the winter had been too much for one of the many rotten spots in its roof. Beams and chunks of tile fell inward. Shelves toppled. Jars and crocks broke and spilled, sacks of grain tore open, and rats got to the food before the cave-in was discovered. Even to begin with, there had been barely enough food stored in the Ark to get everyone through the winter. After that storm, a great part of the food was ruined. <br><br>"Father," Doon said. "Press your hurt hand tight with your other hand. That might keep it from bleeding so much." His father nodded and did as Doon said.<br><br>The rain came harder. In the last rays of evening light, Doon saw the lines of water like silver pins in the air. He put up the hood of his jacket, shivering. When he was faced with troubles, Doon usually looked for solutions and took action. But tonight he was feeling disheartened. So much about the winter in Sparks had been hard. People were ill with coughs and fevers, and some of them had died; they were hungry nearly all the time; and there had been one accident after another. A candle flame caught a curtain and set a house on fire; a toddler wandered outside at night, fell into the river, and drowned; there was the hole in the Ark's roof; and now this gash in his father's hand. Misfortunes came from every direction, it seemed, and Doon could see no way to make things better.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Nice and the Good</h2><p>COFFEE SPOTS ON COVER.

When he recovers, Adam's perceptions of time are altered. He becomes slowly convinced that his bizarre condition could be tied directly to the "Henry" case and that the key may lie in the ancient, mystical practice of trepanation.</p><p>Christos Gage worked as a TV writer on Numb3rs and Law and Order.

He is currently the artist on DC Comics&#39; The Mighty, and Marvel Comics&#39; Siege: Embedded.Grade 9 Up New York Detective Adam Kamen is having a rough time. After his wife unexpectedly loses their baby, she divorces him. His new case, following the decapitating serial killer nicknamed Henry the Eighth, isn't helping his stress level. When he leaps into action one fateful afternoon to stop an apparently insane man from sticking a screwdriver into a baby's skull, it's Kamen who ends up with the hole in his head. He survives, but starts seeing some really weird things. Sometimes people look older, sometimes younger. Sometimes he sees things happen before they actually do. He confides in Dr. Avery, the beautiful woman responsible for his initial recovery. As Kamen draws closer and closer to the killer, everyone around him begins to suspect that he might not be as fully recovered as they first thought. Set in a noir-inspired art style, the black-and-white illustrations first highlight the characters on the page with deceptively detailed backgrounds. Each panel will draw teens into the action while the mysterious story unfolds. It's almost as if each panel is slightly out of focus, mirroring the idea that Kamen cannot rely on what his eyes are really telling him. <i>Ryan Donovan, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What Do You Care What Other People Think? is Feynmans last literary legacy, prepared with his friend and fellow drummer, Ralph Leighton. <br>Among the books many tales, we meet Feynmans first wife, Arlene, who taught him loves irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed, while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. We are also given a fascinating chronicle of the investigation of the space shuttle Challengers explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disasters cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen.</p><p>A thoughtful companion volume to the earlier Surely You Are Joking Mr. Feynman!. Perhaps the most intriguing parts of the book are the behind-the-scenes descriptions of science and policy colliding in the presidential commission to determine the cause of the Challenger space shuttle explosion; and the scientific sleuthing behind his famously elegant O-ring-in-ice-water demonstration. Not as rollicking as his other memoirs, but in some ways more profound.<p><strong>Richard P. Feynman </strong>(1918-1988) earned a BS from MIT and a PhD from Princeton. From 1942 to 1945, he assisted with the development of the atomic bomb. He then taught at Cornell and Caltech, where he contributed to the theories of superfluidity and quarks.

Dale picked up on the third ring. &#x201c;H&#x2019;llo,&#x201d; he mumbled. &#x201c;Why is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Why is it?</p><p>Unlike me, Dale doesn&#x2019;t wake up good. &#x201c;Because,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re auctioning the Tupelo Inn today and if you don&#x2019;t get over here, you&#x2019;ll miss our ride.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mo,&#x201d; he replied, and hung up. Dale&#x2019;s not an inline thinker.</p><p>I gave Sal a thumbs-up as a white minivan wheeled into our gravel parking lot. The Azalea Women, aka the Uptown Garden Club, tumbled out and scattered like pigeons. They chatted their way to the caf� door, and threaded through the crowd.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be glad to see that old inn go,&#x201d; one said as they bumped two red Formica tables together near the jukebox.</p><p>&#x201c;I hear murder closed it down,&#x201d; another added.</p><p>The caf� went quiet.</p><p><i>Murder?</i></p><p>Grandmother Miss Lacy Thornton, who sat at the counter serenely nibbling her toast, whipped around to stare at the Azalea Women. The toes of her navy pumps just grazed the floor. Grandmother Miss Lacy&#x2019;s short, like me. We aren&#x2019;t related by blood; she took me as her honorary granddaughter in first grade. She&#x2019;s the oldestnice person in Tupelo Landing. Also the richest.</p><p>&#x201c;Rumor-mongering,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;How sad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am, it&#x2019;s tragic,&#x201d; I said, and waved at the Azalea Women. &#x201c;Have a seat. I&#x2019;ll be right with you,&#x201d; I called, slipping a clue pad into my pocket.</p><p>Few people know it, but waitressing is like deep cover&#x2014;with tips.</p><p>I ferried a tray of ice water to their table. &#x201c;Did you mention a murder?&#x201d;I asked, dealing the glasses around. &#x201c;Because Desperado Detective Agency is now accepting new clients. Misdemeanors and felonies are our pleasure. Murder&#x2019;s our specialty. How may we help?&#x201d;</p><p>It was borderline true.</p><p>Dale and me opened Desperado Detective Agency at the beginning of the summer and solved our first murder in June. Since then we&#x2019;d had just two cases, both of a Lost Pet nature. First Hannah Greene&#x2019;s dog Mort, who we found running with a bad crowd at the trailer park. Then Sal&#x2019;s goldfish Big Frank, who&#x2019;d gone dust-to-dust behind Sal&#x2019;s aquarium. Dale broke the news: &#x201c;It looks like suicide,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her, his voice grim.</p><p>A second high-profile murder would be good for business.</p><p>The Azalea Women looked away from Grandmother Miss Lacy&#x2019;s icy stare and studied their silverware.</p><p>I tried a different tack. &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s low-carb iced beverage comes to you compliments of me,&#x201d; I said. I draped a paper napkin over my arm. &#x201c;My name is Mo LoBeau, with the accent on the end. I&#x2019;ll be taking care of you ladies today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to introduce yourself, Mo,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve known you since the day you washed into town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;But I like to keep things professional to encourage tips&#x2014;which, by the way, I&#x2019;m saving for college. A possible orphan has to plan ahead. Today,&#x201d; I continued, &#x201c;we got a breakfast menagerie, which is French for sausage and egg casserole with cheese. This comes with hot biscuits au molasses for five dollars. For anyone trying to skinny down, I can substitute you a wheat toast with sugar free. What can I start you with?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee and skinny,&#x201d; they chorused.</p><p>&#x201c;An excellent choice. And your murder selection?&#x201d;</p><p>This time the lead Azalea Woman stared straight at Grandmother Miss Lacy. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t go into details,&#x201d; she sniffed, &#x201c;but I hear Red Baker&#x2019;s involved.&#x201d;</p><p>Crud. Another Red Baker rumor. Grandmother Miss Lacy shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Believe you me,&#x201d; the Azalea Woman continued, her voice going stiletto, &#x201c;whateverhappened out at that old inn&#x2014;if anything did&#x2014;is Red Baker&#x2019;s fault. Or his people&#x2019;s before him.&#x201d;</p><p>I slapped my clue pad closed. A total dead end.</p><p>Red Baker, who lives outside town, mostly keeps to himself. The Colonel says he&#x2019;s second generation moonshine and 100 percent trouble. Mr. Red, who visits the caf� once in a blue moon, has never been mean to me. But it&#x2019;s a town rule that if anything goes wrong, he&#x2019;s behind it. Him or else Dale&#x2019;s daddy, Mr. Macon, if he&#x2019;s out on bail&#x2014;which, at the moment, he ain&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Mark my words,&#x201d; the Azalea Woman said, her eyeglasses swinging on their chain, &#x201c;Red Baker&#x2019;s people have always been bad news. And the apple doesn&#x2019;t fall far from the tree.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mine did,&#x201d; I reminded her. &#x201c;I been searching for my family tree since the day I was born. All I know so far is it&#x2019;s somewhere Upstream.&#x201d; I headed for the kitchen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get your order in right away.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Minutes later, the caf� was hopping. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s chill things down, sugar,&#x201d; Miss Lana said, sashaying toward the air conditioner. Miss Lana&#x2019;s built tall and slender. I&#x2019;m built more like a roller derby queen, but that could change at any minute.</p><p>Puberty happens.</p><p>While Miss Lana cranked the temp down, I turned the overhead fan to a quicker swipe. The auction notice on the bulletin board fluttered in the breeze. &#x201c;Miss Lana,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;are we catering the auction? Because tips should be good once everybody gets whipped into a mindless frenzy, which the Colonel says is inevitable.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled. Her Hollywood-style makeup gave her eyes a smoky, mysterious look. &#x201c;Catering is a lovely idea. But no, you and I will travel incognito as part of the general public today. We&#x2019;ll leave after the breakfast rush,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Miss Thornton&#x2019;s offered us a ride.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Lana doesn&#x2019;t drive as a public courtesy.</p><p>&#x201c;Batter Up,&#x201d; the Colonel barked, coming in from the kitchen. I grabbed Sal&#x2019;s pancakes as the caf� door swung open.</p><p>&#x201c;Greetings, fellow citizens,&#x201d; Mayor Little sang, letting the door bang shut behind him. He smoothed his ice-blue tie over his round belly and took in Miss Lana&#x2019;s dark wig, sundress, and white sandals. &#x201c;Ava Gardner, 1958,&#x201d; he guessed. He cocked his head. &#x201c;Oh my, and Frank Sinatra on the jukebox. How romantic.&#x201d;</p><p>His tasseled loafers tick-tick-ticked across the tile floor. &#x201c;Beautiful day for an auction,&#x201d; he said, slipping onto his regular stool. &#x201c;Buddha gave me the VIP tour yesterday. The entire property is deliciously dilapidated, thoroughly antiquish. Nothing&#x2019;s changed since the day the inn closed. You can&#x2019;t put a price on that kind of charm, my friends. Not until the bidding starts, anyway,&#x201d; he added. He winked at the Azalea Women, who ignored him.</p><p>The Colonel splashed coffee in the mayor&#x2019;s cup. &#x201c;What idiot would buy that dump?&#x201d; the Colonel growled.</p><p>&#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; Tinks Williams said, slapping his John Deere cap against his leg as he strolled in. &#x201c;Roof leaks like a sieve last I heard.&#x201d;</p><p>The mayor tucked his napkin in his collar. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m picturing condos, golf courses&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My friends, Fate smiles on Tupelo Landing today.&#x201d;</p><p>The Colonel snorted, did a quick about-face, and marched into the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Was it something I said?&#x201d; Mayor Little asked, his neat eyebrows drifting up.</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; I said, stepping onto the Pepsi crate I keep behind the counter for extra height. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that the Colonel says Fate is bipolar and ought to be on medications. May I take your order?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The special,&#x201d; he said as Dale rocketed into view on his faded red bike, his mongrel dog Queen Elizabeth II loping behind. He performed a flying dismount at the edge of the parking lot and slung his bike into a patch of shade.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, blasting through the door. His sandals squeaked to a halt and he ran his fingers through his blond hair. The men in Dale&#x2019;s family have scandalous good hair.</p><p>Sal knocked her pancake syrup over.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Dale,&#x201d; Mayor Little said. &#x201c;Solved any murders today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he replied, waving at Sal and me. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s early.&#x201d;</p><p>Like I say, Dale and me solved Mr. Jesse&#x2019;s murder at the beginning of the summer. We went famous for about a week until the gravity of habit pulled our lives back into regular orbit. Small towns have rules. One is, you got to stay who you are no matter how many murders you solve. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m back to being regular Mo LoBeau&#x2014;the girl Luck washed into town the day she was born. And why Dale&#x2019;s back to being just plain Dale, the son of level-headed Miss Rose and the recently incarcerated Macon Johnson.</p><p>&#x201c;Specials, you two?&#x201d; Miss Lana offered, swishing by.</p><p>Dale vaulted onto a stool. Dale is athletic. I ain&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Thanks, Miss Lana,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mama says will you please put it on her tab.&#x201d; Miss Lana smiled and slid us a basket of biscuits. Her and Miss Rose are best friends. There ain&#x2019;t no tab between them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the caf� was standing room only&#x2014;just as Miss Lana had predicted. Dale and me, who&#x2019;d barely had time to brush the crumbs off our chins, flew around the caf�, carrying waters and taking orders. Miss Lana floated between phone, customers, and cash register, graceful as a dandelion seed on the wind.</p><p>I&#x2019;d just cleared a table when Priscilla Retzyl, my teacher, swept in. A coffee cup shattered on the other side of the caf�. &#x201c;No! My new shorts!&#x201d; Dale cried. Even a whisper of teacher rattles him. Dale grabbed one of Miss Lana&#x2019;s aprons, and hustled to take another order.</p><p>As I turned, Anna Celeste Simpson&#x2014;blond hair, brown eyes, perfect smile&#x2014;stiff-armed me to grab a window table.</p><p>I am to Anna Celeste as Sherlock Holmes is to Mori�arty: Enemies for life.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, <i>Attila</i>,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mo-<i>ron</i>,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Mother and I will have the Garden Omelets and tomato juice. Good morning, Miss Retzyl,&#x201d; she simpered, cutting her eyes toward our teacher. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t <i>wait</i> for school to start tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p><i>School. Tomorrow.</i></p><p>The words thudded into my heart like dull wooden stakes.</p><p>&#x201c;Make our omelets to go,&#x201d; Attila&#x2019;s sour-faced mother said, skinnying into the chair across from Attila. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m eager to scout the inn&#x2019;s antiques.&#x201d; She squinted at Attila. &#x201c;Elbows, dear.&#x201d;</p><p>Attila took her elbows off the table.</p><p>I sighed. Take-out mostly means no tips. For me, tips matter. I currently got $7.26 to my name, plus a Canada dime somebody dumped in the tip jar.</p><p>&#x201c;You look tired, Mo,&#x201d; Attila said, smiling to flaunt new braces. &#x201c;Did your family vacation this summer? Mother and I loved Montreal.&#x201d;</p><p>Montreal? In <i>Canada</i>? I reached in my pocket, to my Canada dime.</p><p>I hate Anna Celeste Simpson.</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to put an Official Rush on this order? It only costs a dollar more per plate and that includes your tip,&#x201d; I offered.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Attila said, flouncing her hair.</p><p>I scribbled her order: <i>2 Gardens. Take your time.</i></p><p>As I worked my way back to the counter, Dale stuffed a biscuit in his apron pocket and headed for Queen Elizabeth II, who lay snuffling beneath a shrub. Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s allergic to Miss Lana&#x2019;s rosemary plant. Also the big-haired twins.</p><p>I slid a special to Mayor Little, who smiled at Grandmother Miss Lacy. &#x201c;Miss Thornton, do you remember the old inn&#x2019;s medicinal springs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The springs? Goodness yes,&#x201d; Grandmother Miss Lacy said. &#x201c;Those springs cured hundreds of people. Not everyone who came, of course. Which reminds me: Will the old cemetery be auctioned with the inn?&#x201d;</p><p>The hair on the back of my neck stood up. <i>The old cemetery?</i></p><p>The caf� clattered to silence.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Cemetery</i> is such an unwelcoming word,&#x201d; the mayor chided. &#x201c;I prefer to think of it as a gated community for the dearly departed. Landscaping, ironwork, statuary&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The screech of tires on pavement gobbled up the rest of his words.</p><p>The caf� whipped toward the window as a bright red sports car skidded across the parking lot, spewing an arc of sand.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Dale shouted, stepping in front of Queen Elizabeth. &#x201c;Watch it!&#x201d;</p><p>The car doors flew open. A dark-haired man and a blond woman jumped out, the woman shouting and the man jabbing his finger toward her face.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my,&#x201d; Miss Lana murmured as a boy&#x2014;a younger, thinner version of the man&#x2014;unfolded himself from the car. He wiped his palms on his shiny black slacks, looked from the man to the woman, and then at Dale.</p><p>Dale&#x2019;s flowered apron fluttered in the breeze.</p><p>The boy grabbed the man&#x2019;s arm and pointed. The trio turned to Dale like a pack of jackals. Dale&#x2019;s hand twitched toward the apron, but I knew he&#x2019;d die before he took it off now. The man&#x2019;s laugh cracked like a whip.</p><p><i>Bullies.</i></p><p>My temper sprang straight to my mouth. &#x201c;Hey you,&#x201d; I yelled, charging into the sunshine. &#x201c;Crawl back in that clown car and get out of here....</p></p><h2>History of Rome</h2><p>From a small Iron Age settlement on the banks of the Tiber, Rome grew to become the centre of an Empire that dominated the Western world.

Beyond that, another language is required, one which cannot be committed to paper. Most people confuse iatrochemistry with Alchemy. When an Alchemist speaks of Mercury, Sulphur and Salt, he speaks of his spiritual, astral and physical bodies, not of the elements. Alchemy Unveiled describes the tribulations that a human being has to pass through in order to purify these three bodies. However, to achieve the level of an Alchemist requires daily study and strict daily mental, astral and physical exercises for many lifetimes. Many individuals have already achieved this goal. The purpose is not to convert a lower metal into gold, but to change an impure body into a pure body, namely the spirit, soul and physical bodies. An Alchemist is one who has passed the levels of a magician, spheric magician and Kabbalist. All these levels can be achieved without the help of a teacher! These Western writings are by those who have reached levels higher than an Alchemist. They have given us these writings, philosophically and practically. These sciences cannot be learned intellectually, but have to be approached with a clean heart. One&#39;s character has to be completely free of all negative characteristics. And for the one who embarks on this journey, the first thing to be learned is what a positive characteristic is and what a negative characteristic is. And the reader will be surprised what negative characteristics are, because many of these characteristics are considered by most as positive. Alchemy Unveiled will lead the reader on a journey of a complete purification of the body, soul and spirit, and for the first time the mystery of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone is openly explained. Much has been written about this subject, most of which is and remains incomprehensible for most. Many of the alchemical writings available were and are based on error and point the way to the wrong path. This is mainly due to the fact that many individuals do this for personal, material gain. Alchemy Unveiled begins with an explicit explanation of the symbolic language of Alchemy, which is a must for any further clear understanding of the entire text of this book. It explains the errors of many who were not in possession of the true knowledge regarding this art. It takes the reader on a journey through the ancient mysteries of Initiation, the Osiris mysteries, the Eleusian Mysteries, the Mysteries of Israel, the Christ-Mysterium and the Mystery of Alchemy. An excellent addition to the Franz Bardon books on Hermetics.</p><p>We are all very fortunate to live in a time when all the Mysteries have been revealed. In reality the Mysteries are no longer veiled, but this fact is not yet known to most people on earth. In the last one hundred years two major events have taken place. These events effect every man, woman and child, yet only very few are aware of it, and this is in keeping with the prophesies. In accordance with the prophesies in the Bible the first event took place in the latter part of the last century and it was the proclamation of the Eternal Gospel; and in the 1950&#39;s the Holy Mysteries were revealed. Alchemy Unveiled is part of the Holy Mysteries and it is available to those who make the effort to study it.For centuries, alchemy has fascinated the Western mind. Who were the alchemists? Were they scientists, mystics, or both? What were they really seeking? And what was the secret of the Philosophers&#39; Stone? This rare text, written in German, comes from the hand of a modern alchemist, of whom nothing is known except his name. A work of philosophical alchemy or Hermetic philosophy which concerns itself with the meaning of spirit, body, and soul, it drawn upon the ancient doctrines of the Eleusinian Mysteries as well as upon other aspects of the esoteric Western tradition to reveal the inner truth of the alchemical art. Alchemy Unveiled proves that the alchemical tradition is more than a fragment of the medieval past. The ancient Hermetic art is alive and well, and it still has a deep and lasting value for contemporary humanity.</p><h2>Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads</h2><p>SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER Beloved travel writer Paul Theroux turns his attention to America, exploring the landscapes and communities of his homeland as an outsider for the first time For the past fifty years, Paul Theroux has travelled to the far corners of the earth - to China, India, Africa, the Pacific Islands, South America, Russia, and elsewhere - and brought them to life in his cool, exacting prose. In Deep South he turns his gaze to a region much closer to his home. Travelling through North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, Paul Theroux writes of the stunning landscapes he discovers - the deserts, the mountains, the Mississippi - and above all, the lives of the people he meets. The South is a place of contradictions. There is the warm, open spirit of the soul food cafes, found in every town, no matter how small. There is the ruined grandeur of numberless ghostly towns, long abandoned by the industries that built them. There are the state gun shows and the close-knit,subtly forlorn tribe of people who attend and run them. Deep in the heart of his native country, Theroux discovers a land more profoundly foreign than anything he has previously experienced.</p><p><b> Theroux s eye for landscape remains as sharp as ever . . . It s Theroux s remarkable gift for getting strangers to reveal themselves that makes going along for this ride worthwhile. <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br> Paul Theroux has spent the past fifty years roaming the globe, describing his encounters with remote people and far-flung places in ten best-selling travel books. Now, for the first time, he explores a part of America the Deep South. Setting out on a winding road trip, Theroux discovers a region of architectural and artistic wonders, incomparable music, mouth-watering cuisine and also some of the worst schools, medical care, housing, and unemployment rates in the nation.<br> Yet, no matter where he goes, Theroux meets the unsung heroes of the South, the people who, despite it all, never left, and also those who found their way home and devoted their lives to rebuilding a place they could never live without.<br> <br><b> Paul Theroux s latest travel memoir had me at hello . . .

This isn&#x2019;t just politics, it&#x2019;s literature. It&#x2019;s the great American novel, the kind that isn&#x2019;t written anymore.&#x201d; --Michael Wolff on John Edwards's trajectory, on <i>VanityFair.com</i></p><p>The underside of modern American politics -- raw ambition, manipulation, and deception -- are revealed in detail by Andrew Young&#x2019;s riveting account of a presidential hopeful&#x2019;s meteoric rise and scandalous fall. &nbsp;Like a non-fiction version of <i>All the King&#x2019;s Men</i>, <i>The Politician</i> offers a truly disturbing, even shocking perspective on the risks taken and tactics employed by a man determined to rule the most powerful nation on earth.&nbsp; </p><p>Idealistic and ambitious, Andrew Young volunteered for the John Edwards campaign for Senate in 1998 and quickly became the candidate&#x2019;s right hand man. As the senator became a national star, Young&#x2019;s responsibilities grew. &nbsp;For a decade he was this politician&#x2019;s confidant and he was assured he was &#x2018;like family.&#x201d; &nbsp;In time, however, Young was drawn into a series of questionable assignments that culminated with Edwards asking him to help conceal the Senator&#x2019;s ongoing adultery. Days before the 2008 presidential primaries began, Young gained international notoriety when he told the world that he was the father of&nbsp;a child being carried by a woman named Rielle Hunter, who was actually the senator&#x2019;s mistress. While Young began a life on the run, hiding from the press with his family and alleged mistress, John Edwards continued to pursue the presidency and then the Vice Presidency in the future Obama administration.</p><p>Young had been the senator&#x2019;s closest aide and most trusted friend.&nbsp; He believed that John Edwards could be a great president, and was assured throughout the cover-up that his boss and friend would ultimately step forward to both tell the truth and protect his aide&#x2019;s career. Neither promise was kept.&nbsp; Not only a moving personal account of Andrew Young&#x2019;s political education, THE POLITICIAN offers a look at the trajectory which made John Edwards the ideal Democratic candidate for president, and the hubris which brought him down, leaving his career, his marriage and his dreams in ashes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>John Edwards&#x2019;s longest-serving former aide gives us the inside story&#x2014;in shocking, explosive detail&#x2014;about the meteoric rise and scandalous fall of </p><p><b><i>THE POLITICIAN</i></b></p><p>Andrew Young volunteered for the Edwards campaign for U.S. Senate in 1998 and soon became the Democratic candidate&#x2019;s right-hand man and most trusted friend.

Then, days before his run in the 2008 presidential primaries began, Edwards was faced with a publicity nightmare: Rielle Hunter, the campaign videographer with whom he&#x2019;d been having an affair, was pregnant.

His employers advise everyone from big businesses to governments, and, to this end, expect their 'corporate anthropologist' to help decode and manipulate the world around them -- all the more so now that a giant, epoch-defining project is in the offing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, U. spends his days procrastinating, meandering through endless buffer-zones of information and becoming obsessed by the images with which the world bombards him on a daily basis: oil spills, African traffic jams, roller-blade processions, zombie parades. Is there, U. wonders, a secret logic holding all these images together -- a codex that, once cracked, will unlock the master-meaning of our age? Might it have something to do with South Pacific Cargo Cults, or the dead parachutists in the news? Perhaps; perhaps not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As U. oscillates between the visionary and the vague, brilliance and bullshit,&nbsp;<i>Satin Island</i>&nbsp;emerges, an impassioned and exquisite novel for our disjointed times.</p><p>TOM McCARTHY is the author of&nbsp;<i>Tintin</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Secret of Literature</i>&nbsp;and three internationally celebrated novels:&nbsp;<i>Remainder, Men in Space</i>&nbsp;and, most recently,&nbsp;<i>C</i>, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 2013 he was awarded the inaugural Windham-Campbell Literature Prize by Yale University. His creation, in 1999, of the International Necronautical Society has led to installations and exhibitions in galleries and museums around the world, from Tate Britain and the ICA in London to The Drawing Center in New York.8.<br><br> 8.1 And all this time, behind these apparitions, another one: the image of a severed parachute that floated, like some jellyfish or octopus, through the polluted waters of my mind: the domed canopy above, the floppy strings casually twining their way downwards from this like blithe tentacles, free ends waving in the breeze. This last picture, for me, produces, even now, a sense of calm: no angry and insistent tow, no jerks and tugs and stresses&#x2014;just a set of unencumbered cords carelessly feeling the air. This sense of calm, of languidness, grows all the more pronounced when set against the panic of the man hurtling away from it below. He would have looked up, naturally, and seen the chute lolling unburdened and indifferent above him&#x2014;as though freed from the dense load of all its troubles, that conglomeration of anxiety and nerves that he, and the human form in general, represented. Considering the picture, I found my focus, my point of identification within it and my attendant sympathy, shifting from the diminutive man to his expanded, if detached, paraphernalia. I felt quite happy for the latter, for its liberation into carefreeness. Parachutes, as a rule, are treated badly by their human masters: granted false release and then immediately yanked back into servitude, into yoked bondage. This one, though, had slipped the bridle&#x2014;literally&#x2014; and billowed out into a freedom that was permanent and real. Its existence would have been a good and full one from this moment onwards.<br> &nbsp;<br> 8.2 The following weekend, the newspaper&#x2014;the old-style broadsheet, I mean&#x2014;carried a longer, more reflective article about the case. Its author was an occasional skydiver himself. He discussed the culture of the sport, its general fraternity. Sky- divers, he informed his readers, are a close-knit bunch. They have, he wrote, the feeling of being part of a tribe. This sentence jumped out at me, for obvious reasons; on reading it, I looked up at the byline, to see if I recognized the journalist&#x2019;s name. I didn&#x2019;t. I thought of my Vanuatans once again. In their tower- plunging ritual, the vines, as I mentioned earlier, were measured so as to tauten not in mid-air but rather only fractionally above the earth: the jumps deemed the best, the ones that won the diver most acclaim, were those in which the cords sprang into action as he hit the ground, plucking him back from the very jaws of death into which they&#x2019;d tantalizingly allowed him, for a fraction of a second, to descend. On such perfectly realized jumps, the diver&#x2019;s shoulders would flick leaves and brushwood as they jerked back upwards, as though impudently scrawling the man&#x2019;s signature across the forest floor. The movement was extremely pleasing to observe. It was this act of scrawling, this graffiti-gesture, I now realized, that, above all other aspects of the ritual, had back then made me want to be a tower-plunger, or anthropologist, or both.<br> &nbsp;<br> 8.3 The article kept mentioning &#x201c;faith.&#x201d; Skydivers are induced into and graduate up through a world in which faith plays a fundamental role. They must believe in their instructors; in the equipment; in the staff packing their rigs; in tiny ring-pulls, clips and clip-releases, strips of canvas, satin, string. It could be argued, wrote the author, that this belief had nothing of the devotional or metaphysical about it, since each of the things to be believed in had a solid evidential underpinning: the mechanics of a ripcord, say, or a spring-loaded riser&#x2014;or, of course, on a larger scale, the overall infallibility of physics, its laws of resistance, drag and so on. Yet, he claimed, these things could only carry one so far towards a gaping hole in a plane&#x2019;s side, and the fundamentally counterintuitive act of throwing oneself through it: to cite the clich�d but apt maxim, they could take the horse to water, but they couldn&#x2019;t make it drink. That final spur, the one that carried skydivers across the threshold, out into the abyss, was faith: faith that it all&#x2014;the system, in its boundless and unquantifiable entirety&#x2014;worked, that they&#x2019;d be gathered up and saved. For this man, though, the victim, that system, its whole fabric, had unraveled. That, and not his death, was the catastrophe that had befallen him. We&#x2019;re all going to die: there&#x2019;s nothing so disastrous about that, nothing in its ineluctability that undermines the structure of our being. But for the faith, the blind, absolute faith into whose arms he had entrusted his existence, from whose mouth he&#x2019;d sought a whispered affirmation of its very possibility&#x2014;for that to suddenly be plucked away: that must have been atrocious. He&#x2019;d have looked around him, seen the sky, and earth, its landmass and horizon, all the vertical and horizontal axes that hold these together, felt acceleration and the atmosphere and all the rest, the fundamental elements in which we hang suspended all the time, whether we&#x2019;ve just jumped from an aeroplane or not&#x2014; and yet, for him, this realm, with all its width and depth and volume, would have, in an instant, become emptied of its properties, its values. The vast font at which he prayed, and into which he sank, as though to re-baptize himself, time and again, would, in the blink of a dilated eye, have been voided of god- head, rendered meaningless. Space, even as he plunged into it, through it, would have retreated&#x2014;recoiled, contracted, pulled back from its frontiers even though these stayed intact&#x2014; withdrawn to some zero-point at which it flips into its negative. Negative world, negative sky, negative everything: that&#x2019;s the territory this man had entered. Did that then mean he&#x2019;d some- how fallen through into another world, another sky? A richer, fuller, more embracing one? I don&#x2019;t think so.<br><br>Excerpted from Satin Island by Tom McCarthy. Copyright � 2015 by Tom McCarthy.

At the heart of &#34;Master of the Senate&#34; is its revelation of how legislative power works, how the US Senate works, how Lyndon Johnson on his way to the presidency mastered both and how he used his power to pass the first Civil Rights legislation since 1868. Interweaving his narrative of Johnson&#39;s political career during the 1950s with concise and acute history of the Senate, Caro shows us: how Johnson, employing his guile, his unerring instinct about his colleagues and his strategic brilliance, became Majority Leader after only one term, and soon the most powerful man in the Senate; how the youngest and greatest Senate leader changed the &#34;unchangeable&#34; Senate from a loose confederation of sovereign senators to a tightly run legislative machine; how he destroyed the one man who threatened the monetary invincibility of the Texas oil barons who had financed Johnson&#39;s rise to power; and how Johnson changed the course of Civil Rights in America.</p><p>Robert Caro's <i>Master of the Senate</i> examines in meticulous detail Lyndon Johnson's career in that body, from his arrival in 1950 (after 12 years in the House of Representatives) until his election as JFK's vice president in 1960. This, the third in a projected four-volume series, studies not only the pragmatic, ruthless, ambitious Johnson, who wielded influence with both consummate skill and "raw, elemental brutality," but also the Senate itself, which Caro describes (pre-1957) as a "cruel joke" and an "impregnable stronghold" against social change. The milestone of Johnson's Senate years was the 1957 Civil Rights Act, whose passage he single-handedly engineered. As important as the bill was--both in and of itself and as a precursor to wider-reaching civil rights legislation--it was only close to Johnson's Southern "anti-civil rights" heart as a means to his dream: the presidency. Caro writes that not only does power corrupt, it "reveals," and that's exactly what this massive, scrupulously researched book does. A model of social, psychological, and political insight, it is not just masterful; it is a masterpiece. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>"A wonderful, a glorious tale . . . It will be hard to equal this amazing book. It reads like a Trollope novel, but not even Trollope explored the ambitions and the gullibilities of men as deliciously as Robert Caro does." --Anthony Lewis, <i>New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>"Mesmerizing . . . A tale rife with drama and hypnotic in the telling . . .The historian's equivalent of a Mahler symphony . . . [It] brings Lyndon blazing into the Senate." --Malcolm Jones, <i>Newsweek</i><br><br>"Caro must be America's greatest living Presidential biographer . . . No other contemporary biographer offers such a complex picture of the forces driving an American politician, or populates his work with such vividly drawn secondary characters." --Richard S. Dunham, <i>BusinessWeek<br></i><br>"A panoramic study . . . Combining the best techniques of investigative reporting with majestic storytelling ability, Caro has created a vivid, revelatory institutional history as well as a rich hologram of Johnson's character." --Jill Abramson, <i>New York Times<br><br></i>"Probably the best book ever written about the U.S. Senate. A terrific study of power politics." --Steve Neal, <i>Chicago Sun-Times<br></i><br>"After more than a quarter of a century of research and thought about Lyndon Johnson, Caro sees the man in full . . . Caro's immersion in the man and period yields a fascinating, entertaining abundance." --Lance Morrow, <i>Time<br><br></i>"Brilliant . . . An indefatigable researcher and dazzling prose stylist, Caro has pulled off the seemingly impossible: He has converted the mundane legislative agenda of the Truman-Eisenhower era into a riveting political drama worthy of Robert Penn Warren." --Douglas Brinkley, <i>Boston Globe<br></i><br>"In this fascinating book, Robert Caro does more than carry forward his epic life of Lyndon Johnson. With compelling narrative power and with remarkable subtlety and sensitivity, he illuminates the Senate of the United States and its byzantine power struggles. In this historical tour-de-force, Robert Caro shows himself the true 'master of the Senate.' " --Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<br><br>"To immerse oneself in Robert Caro's heroic biographies is to come face to face with a shocking but unavoidable realization: Much of what we think we know about money, power and politics is a fairy tale . . . <i>Master of the Senate </i>forces us not only to rewrite our national political history but to rethink it as well . . . Compulsively readable." --Eric Alterman, <i>The Nation<br><br></i>"<i>A</i> spectacular piece of historical biography, delicious reading for both political junkies and serious students of the political process . . . Fascinating . . .Worth the wait." --Robert D. Novak, <i>The Weekly Standard<br></i><br>"In terms of political biography, not only does it not get better than this, it can't . . .The highest expression of biography as art . . . Caro's command of his material is absolute . . . As absorbing as an epic movie." --Patrick Beach, <i>Austin American-Statesman<br></i><br>"<i>Master of the Senate </i>is vintage Caro--a portrait so deft, vivid, and compelling that you practically feel LBJ gripping your arm and bending you to his will." --Jean Strouse<br><br>"The most complete portrait of the Senate ever drawn. The work, told within the framework of the life of Lyndon Johnson, is really an epic history of the twentieth century." --Michael Wolff, <i>New York</i><br><br>"Every paradox that makes politics truly, endlessly, fascinating . . . is there in . . .<i>The Years of Lyndon Johnson </i>. . .Regarded by many as the greatest political biography of the modern era. Essential reading for those who want to comprehend power and politics." --Daniel Finkelstein, <i>The Times </i>(London)<br><br>"For Caro writing a biography is writing a thriller--in Johnson's case, a western. You can't stop turning the pages." --Michael Howard, <i>The Times </i>(London)<br><br>"Quite breathtaking . . . One of the great political biographies." --Gordon Brown, <i>The Times </i>(London)<br><br>"An epic tale of winning and wielding power." --Dan DeLuca, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer<br></i><br>"In this magnificent work, Robert Caro has given us the grand and absorbing saga of Lyndon Johnson, the U.S. Senate, and the Democratic Party at mid-century. The richly cadenced prose is hypnotic, the research prodigious, the analysis acute, the mood spellbinding, and the cast of characters mythic in scale. I cannot conceive of a better book about Capitol Hill. An unforgettable, epic achievement in the art of biography." --Ron Chernow<br><br>"Caro is a master of biography . . . with his Tolstoyan touch for storytelling and drama . . . A dazzling tour de force that certifies Caro as the country's preeminent specialist in examining political power and its uses." --Paul Duke, <i>Baltimore Sun <br><br></i>"A gripping tale of suspense. The narrative tension rarely dissipates . . . We know that Johnson will ultimately succeed, but the thrill lies in learning how." --Jordan Rau, <i>Newsday<br><br></i>"Masterful . . . A work of genius." --Steve Weinberg, <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune<br><br></i>"Breathtaking to read, like spending a week curled up with a magnificent political novel." --Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>Modern Maturity<br><br></i>"Caro writes history with [a] novelist's sensitivity . . . No historian offers a more vivid sense not only of what happened, but what it looked like and felt like." --Bob Minzesheimer, <i>USA Today<br></i><br>"Caro drives the story forward irresistibly . . . If Mr Caro's work on Johnson has not already set a new standard in American political biography, it surely will when his story of Johnson's presidency is complete." --<i>The Economist</i><br><br>"Does it live up to the profound success of the earlier volumes? The answer is a resounding yes . . . The biography of the season." --Brad Hooper,<i> Booklist<br></i><br>"Uniquely mesmerizing." --<i>Publishers Weekly<br></i><br>"Magisterial . . .

Paul holds up the humble submission of Christ as the pattern to be followed. The commentary thus seeks both to explain the meaning of the text and to show its application to the Church's life today.</p> <p>Colossians focuses on the all-sufficient Christ. The Lord Jesus deserves the place, not a place in the lives of Christians. The Colossian Christians were being diverted by alluring alternatives. Paul resisted this, as we must today in the face of extreme fundamentalisms and secular mysticisms. We must know the non-negotiable essence of the Christian gospel.</p> <p>An excellent resource for personal study, and especially helpful for those involved in the teaching ministries of the church, the Wesleyan Bible Study Commentary series will encourage and promote life change in believers by applying God's authoritative truth in relevant, practical ways. Written in an easy-to-follow format, you will enjoy studying Scripture insights that are faithful to the Wesleyan-Armenian perspective.</p></p><p>Earle L.

Fry's deepest regrets seem to be the elusiveness of a particular boy's love and the fact that, despite his keen ear for music, Fry's singing voice can make listeners "claw out their inner ears, electrocute their genitals, put on a Jim Reeves record, throw themselves cackling hysterically onto the path of moving buses... anything, anything to take away the pain." A chance mention of Fry's time-travel book about thwarting Hitler, <i>Making History</i> (a finalist for the 1998 Sidewise Award for Best Alternative History), leads to the startling real-life revelation that Fry's own Jewish uncle may have loaned a young, shivering Hitler the coat off his back. </p><p> Fry's life is full of school and jailhouse blues overcome by jaunty wit, � la <i>Wilde</i>. The title, from Psalm 108:9, refers to King David's triumph over the Philistines. Fry triumphs similarly, and with more style. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>A number one bestseller in Britain that topped the lists there for months, Stephen Fry's astonishingly frank, funny, wise memoir is the book that his fans everywhere have been waiting for. Since his PBS television debut in the Blackadder series, the American profile of this multitalented writer, actor and comedian has grown steadily, especially in the wake of his title role in the film Wilde, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and his supporting role in A Civil Action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Fry has already given readers a taste of his tumultuous adolescence in his autobiographical first novel, <i>The Liar</i>, and now he reveals the equally tumultuous life that inspired it. Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, he survived beatings, misery, love affairs, carnal violation, expulsion, attempted suicide, criminal conviction and imprisonment to emerge, at the age of eighteen, ready to start over in a world in which he had always felt a stranger. One of very few Cambridge University graduates to have been imprisoned prior to his freshman year, Fry is a brilliantly idiosyncratic character who continues to attract controversy, empathy and real devotion. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This extraordinary and affecting book has "a tragic grandeur that lifts it to classic status," raved the <i>Financial Times</i> in one of the many ecstatic British reviews. Stephen Fry's autobiography, in turns funny, shocking, sad, bruisingly frank and always compulsively readable, could well become a classic gay coming-of-age memoir.</p><h2>Passport to Anywhere: The Story of Lars-Eric Lindblad</h2><p>Lars-Eric Lindblad&#39;s 1983 autobiography, Passport to Anywhere.

Nicknamed "Sweetness" during his college football days, he became the NFL's all-time leader in rushing and all-purpose yards, capturing the hearts of fans in his adopted Chicago. </p> <p>Crafted from interviews with more than 700 sources, acclaimed sportswriter Jeff Pearlman has produced the first definitive biography of Payton. <i>Sweetness</i> at last brings fans a detailed, scrupulously researched, all-encompassing account of the legend's rise to greatness.

Since the publication of the second edition more than a decade ago, many substantive changes have occurred in both the legal and operational environments affecting seagoing vessels and their crews. In response to these changes, this book has been completely updated and been renamed to include masters on all seagoing vessels, including oceangoing tugs. A complete guide for the newly appointed master, it is also useful to experienced masters as a checklist for the voluminous paperwork required in all phases of business aboard, including shipping articles, vessel documents and certificates, crew lists, customs and immigration requirements, accounting procedures, bills of lading, charter parties, vessel accidents, and logbooks. The master of a vessel is required to comply with state and federal laws that apply to the vessel and crew, the laws of foreign countries when the vessel is in their waters, and applicable international law. Mastering the details of these various jurisdictions can be intimidating, but this handbook demystifies the regulations and states the requirements in plain language. New topics in the third edition include vessel security, communications, and flag etiquette.

Written by the top performers in the field, it covers the details of working in the world of protection specialists in a theoretical yet practical manner.</p><p>This is a totally new and different follow-up book to the highly successful Providing Executive Protection. It has been written by recognized practitioners, writers, and world class authorities on executive protection subjects. It goes beyond the basic mechanics of providing protection, covering such specific concerns as advance work, the use of K9s, media encounters, ethics, traits, and hiring a protection specialist, professional dress and appearance, electronic surveillance and countermeasures, intelligence operations, aircraft security, and handling confrontations.A true sequel to the highly successful volume of instruction published first in 1991 under the title, Providing Executive Protection, this second volume goes deep into a rich soil of knowledge tilled and worked over by a small band of dedicated professionals. Its thoroughness is a response to the increase in domestic crime and worldwide terrorism which have created the need for updated and improved protective services. The watchword, for those who provide protective services, is, eternally, vigilance. The Personal Protection Specialist can never afford to rest upon his or her laurels. An impeccable, professional career, attested by the years, can be destroyed in a heartbeat by a moment&#39;s inattention, or the cruel, inexorable swiftness of the assassin&#39;s bullet, bomb, or slashing blade. Over the years, we have insisted on the need to expect the unexpected. It is the kinetic energy by which the profession is driven. This is a stressful business and, once again, that subject finds, in a practical way, further, insightful expression in these pages. A book for those who need protection; those who manage protective services, and those who provide or wish to provide personal protection.</p><h2>Uprooted: On the Trail of the Green Man</h2><p><p>Who, or what, is the Green Man, and why is this medieval image so present in our precarious modern times?</p><p>An encounter with the Green Man at an ancient Herefordshire church in the wake of catastrophic weather leads Nina Lyon into an exploration of how the foliate heads of Norman stonemasons have evolved into today's cult symbols. </p><p>The Green Man's association with the pantheistic beliefs of Celtic Christianity and with contemporary neo-paganism, with the shamanic traditions of the Anglo-Saxons and as a figurehead for ecological movements sees various paths crossing into a picture that reveals the hidden meanings of twenty-first-century Britain. Against a shifting backdrop of mountains, forests, rivers and stone circles, a cult of the Green Man emerges, manifesting itself in unexpected ways.

Whether you are part of a master naturalist program, are interested in environmentally friendly pest management, or simply enjoy knowing what to call that strange-looking bug on your back porch, <i>Insects of Texas</i> will be your first resource for insect classification and identification.&nbsp;This book will help you sort out many of the millions of insect species by learning the readily distinguishable field characteristics needed to identify groups most commonly seen in Texas. David H. Kattes provides short tutorials on morphology and metamorphosis and uses a simple color-coding scheme to present the five classes of arthropods and the orders, suborders, and families of insects most relevant to Texas observers. Photo keys, pronunciation guides, illustrated tables, abundant photographs, and highlighted accounts of physical and biological characteristics help introduce readers to the various tiny creatures that inhabit our world, steering them through arachnids, crustaceans, millipedes, centipedes, and hexapods. Within each account, Kattes comments on habits and other interesting information, reflecting his long experience in teaching and speaking to a variety of receptive audiences.</p><p>DAVID H.

With <i>Lisey's Story</i>, once again King is trying something different. <i>Lisey's Story</i> is as much a romance as it is a supernatural thriller--but don't let us convince you. Who better to tell readers if King has written a romantic thriller than Nora Roberts? We asked Nora to read <i>Lisey's Story</i> and give us her take. Check out her review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Nora Roberts</strong><br><br><b>Nora Roberts, who also writes under the pseudonym J.D. Robb, is the author of way too many bestselling books to name here (over 150!), but some of our favorites include: <i>Angels Fall</i>, <i>Born in Death</i>, <i>Blue Smoke</i>, and <i>The Reef</i>.</b> <br><br> Stephen King hooked me about three decades ago with that sharply faceted, blood-stained jewel, <i>The Shining</i>. Through the years he's bumped my gooses with kiddie vampires, tingled my spine with beloved pets gone rabid, justified my personal fear of clowns and made me think twice about my cell phone. I've always considered <i>The Stand</i>--a long-time favorite--a towering tour de force, and have owed its author a debt as this was the first novel I could convince my older son to read from cover to cover.<p> But with <i>Lisey's Story</i>, King has accomplished one more feat. He broke my heart.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is, at its core, a love story--heart-wrenching, passionate, terrifying and tender. It is the multi-layered and expertly crafted tale of a twenty-five year marriage, and a widow's journey through grief, through discovery and--this is King, after all--through a nightmare scape of the ordinary and extraordinary. Through Lisey's mind and heart, the reader is pulled into the intimacies of her marriage to bestselling novelist Scott Landon, and through her we come to know this complicated, troubled and heroic man.</p><p> Two years after his death, Lisey sorts through her husband's papers and her own shrouded memories. Following the clues Scott left her and her own instincts, she embarks on a journey that risks both her life and her sanity.

But there is also the Churchill who frequently inveighed against human rights, nationalism, and constitutional progress&#x2014;the imperialist who could celebrate racism and believed India was unsuited to democracy.

He studied at the universities of Birmingham and Cambridge, and is now an associate professor at the University of Exeter. He has written extensively on British and international history. In 2007 he was named Young Academic Author of the Year by <i>Times Higher Education</i> magazine for his book <i>Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness.</i></p><p>Prologue </p><p>On 10 December 1954 a visitor from East Africa was waiting on a horsehair sofa in the hallway of 10 Downing Street. Suddenly, the small, frail figure of Winston Churchill appeared from behind a screen, said, 'Good afternoon, Mr Blundell,' and offered him a slightly stiffened hand to shake. The two men went together into the Cabinet Room. It was only three o'clock but Churchill &#x2014; smoking his customary cigar &#x2014; ordered them both a strong whisky and soda. As they sipped their drinks, their meeting, scheduled to take fifteen minutes, spilled out to last forty-five. The topic was the Mau Mau rebellion against British colonial rule in Kenya; and Michael Blundell, a prominent white settler with a somewhat spurious reputation as a liberal, was given an impassioned exposition of the Prime Minister's views. </p><p>Churchill began by recalling his own visit to the country in 1907. Then, he had found the Kikuyu group, from which most of the rebels were now drawn, to be 'a happy, naked and charming people'. He professed himself 'astonished at the change which had come over their minds'. He became animated over the problem of how settlers might be protected from attack, and he poured out a flood of ideas designed to defend farmers: trip-wires, bells and other early warning systems. But in his view the issue was not really a military one &#x2014; the problem was to get to the rebels' minds. His eyes grew tearful as he told Blundell of the threat the situation posed to Britain's good name in the world. It was terrible that the country that was the home of culture, magnanimity and democracy should be using force to suppress Mau Mau. 'It's the power of a modern nation being used to kill savages. It's pretty terrible,' he declared. 'Savages, savages? Not savages. They're savages armed with ideas &#x2014; much more difficult to deal with.' </p><p>Over and again he pressed on a reluctant Blundell the need for negotiation, arguing that the strength of the hold the Mau Mau had on the Kikuyu proved that the latter were not primitive, stupid and cowardly, as was often imagined. Rather, 'they were persons of considerable fibre and ability and steel, who could be brought to our side by just and wise treatment'. He offered an analogy with his own role in finding a solution for the problem of Ireland after World War I, when he had negotiated with the nationalist leader Michael Collins, once a hard-line terrorist opponent of the British. Churchill also deplored British brutality against the Kenyan rebels and the fact that so many of the local population were locked up in detention camps, before offering his views on race relations. He was old-fashioned, he said, and 'did not really think that black people were as capable or as efficient as white people'. All the same, 'If I meet a black man and he's a civilized educated fellow I have no feelings about him at all.' He showed some scepticism about the white settlers too, 'a highly individualistic and difficult people', although he put some of their attitude down to 'tension from the altitude' in the highland areas in which they lived. When Blundell asked him for a message of encouragement to pass on to them, he declined, but, as his visitor got up to leave, Churchill assured him that he was on the right path and had his support. Blundell wished him a slightly belated happy eightieth birthday, and the Prime Minister looked greatly touched. He was beginning to feel his age, he said. Then he revealed a secret that had been kept from the outside world: 'Hm. I've had two strokes. Most people don't know that, but it's a fact. I keep going.' Blundell deduced that this accounted for the stiffened handshake at the beginning. Churchill walked him to the exit of the room and then, when Blundell had gone about five steps into the hall, wished him goodbye and good luck.1 </p><p>This conversation did not mark any great turning point in the history of Kenya. Churchill, just months from retirement, was no longer in a position to be a major influence on colonial policy. Nevertheless, it was highly revealing of his attitudes to race and Empire, touching numerous themes that had been present throughout his career. There were so many familiar hallmarks: the gift for a phrase ('savages armed with ideas'), the recollection of a happier, more innocent past, the emphasis on magnanimity and negotiating from strength. Also familiar was his unashamed belief in white superiority, a conviction which, for him, however, did not lessen the need to act humanely towards supposedly inferior races that might, in their own way, be worthy of admiration. Recognizable as part of this was his opinion that members of these races might earn equal treatment, if not exactly warm acceptance, provided they reached an approved cultural standard: a 'civilized educated' black man would provoke 'no feelings' in him. Overall, the striking thing is the complexity of his opinions. He emerges from Blundell's account of the discussion as a holder of racist views but not as an imperial diehard. He comes across in his plea for peace talks as a thoughtful visionary, but also, in his description of the formerly 'happy, naked' Kikuyu, as curiously nav�ve about the realities of imperialism. He was prepared to question the conduct of a dirty colonial war, but was in the end willing to assure its supporters of his backing. </p><p>Churchill's conversation with Blundell is a good starting point for consideration of his lifelong involvement with the British Empire, and the general attitudes to it from which his specific policies fl owed. In order to do this we need to contend with his reputation &#x2014; or reputations &#x2014; on imperial issues. The popular image of him, which draws in particular on his opposition to Indian independence in the 1930s and 1940s, is of a last-ditcher for whom the integrity of the Empire was paramount. Yet many of his contemporaries had viewed him differently. As a youthful minister at the Colonial Office in the Edwardian period, political antagonists had described him as a Little Englander and a danger to the Empire. ('Little Englandism', which today carries connotations of anti-European xenophobia, at the time implied opposition to imperial expansion and to foreign entanglements in general; it was often used as a term of abuse.) As late as 1920, even the wild-eyed socialist MP James Maxton would claim disapprovingly that 'the British Empire was approaching complete disintegration' and that 'it was not going too far to say that Mr Churchill had played a primary party in bringing about that state of affairs'.2 Such critics, it should be noted, were not alleging that Churchill was actively hostile to the Empire, more that it was not safe in his hands or that he was comparatively indifferent to it. By the time of Churchill's final term in office, this view was still maintained by a tenacious few. In 1953 the Conservative politician Earl Winterton wrote to Leo Amery, one of Churchill's former wartime colleagues, to congratulate him on the first volume of his memoirs. He told him: 'I am particularly pleased that you have, whilst paying a tribute to Winston's great patriotism, stated, which is indubitably the case, that he has never been an imperialist in the sense that you and I are; we suffered from this point of view during the war, whilst we were in opposition after the war and are still suffering from it to-day.'3 </p><p>Although similar opinions can be found in the historical literature, such contemporary opinions of Churchill need to be treated with some caution.4 Those who accused him of not caring enough about the Empire often meant, underneath, that he did not happen to share their particular view of it. Nor is the conventional image completely misleading. Although during his post-1931 wilderness years Churchill publicly disclaimed the diehard label, it is clear that he came to revel in it. During the war, the topic of India frequently triggered such extreme reactions in him that he sometimes appeared not quite sane.5 Nevertheless, this man who could be so disdainful of non- white peoples &#x2014; 'I hate people with slit eyes &amp; pig-tails' &#x2014; also had another side to him.6 In 1906, when criticizing the 'chronic bloodshed' caused by British punitive raids in West Africa, it was he who sarcastically wrote: 'the whole enterprise is liable to be misrepresented by persons unacquainted with Imperial terminology as the murdering of natives and stealing of their lands'.7 As his talk with Blundell shows, this concern for the welfare of subject peoples stayed with him until the end of his career. In 1921, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, he stated that within the British Empire 'there should be no barrier of race, colour or creed which should prevent any man from reaching any station if he is fitted for it'. Yet he immediately qualified this by adding that 'such a principle has to be very carefully and gradually applied because intense local feelings are excited', which was in effect a way of saying that its implementation should be delayed indefinitely.8 As one Indian politician put it the following year, when noting Churchill's seemingly inconsistent position on the controversial question of Asians in East Africa, it was 'a case, and a very strange case indeed', of the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.9 </p><p>Therefore, in order to understand the origins and impact of Churchill's imperialism, we do not need to overthrow the conventional picture so much as to understand how it arose. We also need to see why, during the second half of his career, it came to crowd out the story in which he appeared as a conciliator and even as a Radical. In order to do these things, we need a firm grasp of the world in which he grew up and began to make his career at the end of the nineteenth century. The British Empire at that time was in a phase of rapid expansion, driven by multiple forces, from private trading and missionary activity to international great-power rivalries. At the time of Churchill's birth, in 1874, it was about to embark on its most triumphant phase. In 1877, amid great controversy, Queen Victoria was crowned 'Empress of India', in a symbolic adornment of the longstanding British control of the subcontinent. During the 1880s, Britain took part in the 'scramble for Africa', a race between Europe an powers for colonies, acquiring Bechuanaland, Nigeria, Somaliland, Zululand, Kenya, Rhodesia and (in 1890) Zanzibar. This was by no means the end point of the growth of the Empire; there were further acquisitions at the end of World War I and, if enemy colonies conquered during World War II are taken into account, it reached its maximum territorial extent only in 1945.10 At its zenith, around 500 million people, or about a quarter of the world's population, were British subjects. </p><p>The very speed of the expansion, and the multiplicity of motives behind it, helped ensure a great diversity in methods of rule. Terminology shifted throughout the period of Churchill's lifetime &#x2014; for example 'Commonwealth' gradually replaced 'Empire', to his considerable chagrin &#x2014; but for the period of his political maturity certain broad generalizations are possible. Loosely speaking, the 'dominions' were those territories such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada which had achieved a substantial (and progressively increasing) level of political autonomy.11 During the interwar years they gained the formal right to secede from the Empire if they wished. The 'colonies', by contrast, were overseas possessions where the Crown retained proprietorship. They might nonetheless be 'self- governing', which meant that the white settler elites had considerable control over local affairs. There were also other forms of governance, including the League of Nations 'mandates' granted to Britain after World War I, as for example in Palestine. India, anomalously, was neither a dominion nor a colony, British rule there being to a substantial extent based on cooperation with loyal Indian princes.12 </p><p>Such distinctions were probably lost on the majority of the British population at the time.13 This, however, does not necessarily constitute proof that the masses were indifferent to the Empire. Churchill, for one, believed that the imperial zeitgeist of his schoolboy years had left 'a permanent imprint upon the national mind'.14 As Churchill's headmaster at Harrow school put it in 1895: if the Elizabethan era marks the beginning, it is not less true that the Victorian era marks the consummation of the British Empire. The seventeenth century may be said to be the age of individual explorers, the eighteenth of commercial companies, the nineteenth of the State. [ . . . ] It is not the expansion of Empire, it is the spirit of Empire, which is the characteristic of the reign of Queen Victoria.15 </p><p>This new spirit may have been largely restricted to elites; but then, Churchill was one of the elite. </p><p>The observation that this background was important is hardly original. When Jawaharlal Nehru (who was to become the first Prime Minister of independent India) remarked during World War II that Churchill had 'a Victorian mind' it served as a convenient way of saying that he was a reactionary.16 Historians criticizing Churchill have often used similar shorthand.17 Churchill's defenders also point to his Victorianism, but present it in a different way. For example his former private secretary John Colville, in a foreword to a new edition of <i>The River War</i>, Churchill's 1899 work on Kitchener's Sudan campaign, wrote the following. </p><p>Churchill's imperialism, faithfully representing the feelings of his fellow-countrymen at this apogee of the British Empire, emerges clearly from this book: but it should be judged by the generally accepted standards prevailing at the end of the Victorian era and not by those in fashion today. [ . . . ] Churchill, for his part, was antagonised by Kitchener's ruthless treatment of the defeated Dervishes, whose courage he respected.18 </p><p>Similarly, one sympathetic historian, seeking to explain Churchill's toleration of discrimination against black Africans, writes: 'Churchill was a Victorian by upbringing [ . . . ] and most Britons of his generation regarded black Africans as backward and relatively uncivilized.' But, he adds, 'Churchill's own outlook was more informed and relatively enlightened.'19 </p><p>The defenders' pleas for contextualization are, on the surface, highly plausible. However, they are also problematic. References to 'generally accepted standards', and to the views of 'most Britons', do less than full justice to the range of opinion in Victorian Britain to which Churchill was exposed. Furthermore, we are being asked to believe two contradictory things simultaneously. On the one hand, it is suggested, the seemingly unpleasant aspects of his racial thinking can be excused on the grounds that he could not have been expected to escape from the mentality prevailing during his youth. On the other hand, we are told, he <i>did</i> escape it and is to be praised because he was actually unusually enlightened! We should not, in fact, use Churchill's Victorian background as an historical 'get out of jail free' card for him any more than we should use it as a blanket label of condemnation. In order to understand its true importance, it is necessary to appreciate that his Victorian heritage accounted for many of the apparently 'enlightened' ele...</p></p><h2>Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops: The Influence of Dutch on the North American Languages</h2><p>In 1609, the first Dutch settlers arrived in America and established trading posts, small towns, and forts up and down what we now call the Hudson River. To this day, American children are taught the thrilling history of the transformation of this settlement, New Netherland, and its capital, New Amsterdam, from landmark port into present-day New York State and the island of Manhattan. But, the Dutch legacy extended far beyond New York, as Cookies, Coleslaw and Stoops reveals. From Santa Claus (after the Dutch folklore saint Sinterklaas) and his sleigh (the pronunciation of the Dutch slee is almost identical) to a dumbhead talking poppycock, the contributions of the Dutch language to American English are indelibly embedded to some of our most vernacular terms and expressions. The menu in most of our restaurants sports some originally Dutch names, and even our dollar is named after a Dutch coin (daalder). In this captivating volume, the renowned linguist Nicoline van der Sijs glosses over 300 Dutch loan words like these that travelled to the New World on board the Dutch ship the Halve Maan, captained by Henry Hudson, which dropped anchor in Manhattan more than 400 years ago. Surprisingly, the Dutch also gave several Native American languages words for everyday things like &#x201c;pants&#x201d;, &#x201c;cat&#x201d; and &#x201c;turkey&#x201d;. Lively and accessible, the information presented in this volume charts the journey of these words into the American territory and languages, from more obscure uses which maybe have survived in only regional dialects to such ubiquitous contributions to our language like Yankee, cookie, and dope. Each entry marks the original arrival of its term into American English and adds up-to-date information on its evolving meaning, etymology, and regional spread. Not to be missed by anyone with a passion for the history behind our everyday expressions, Cookies, Coleslaw and Stoops is the perfect gift for the linguistic adventurer in us all.</p><p>Nicoline van der Sijs is a linguist and a coeditor of the multi-volume Dutch Etymological Dictionary.<p>&#x201c;As a kid in New York&#x2019;s Mohawk Valley I played along the laag kill, called out Kip, Kip, Kip! to our chickens at feeding time, talked to friends on their stoeps after school, and got winklehawks in my blue jeans from scrambling through barbed wire fences. It wasn&#x2019;t until years later that I realized how many Dutch expressions survived in my dialect. This book is a linguistic treasure chest for anyone who grew up in the area covered by the Dutch colony of New Netherland.&#x201d;</p> (Charles Gehring, New York State Library)</p><h2>Jewish With Feeling: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Practice</h2><p>One of the great innovators in Jewish history writes a practical guide to Jewish living in a modern world. <br><br> Scholar, mystic, teacher, friend to spiritual teachers from Thomas Merton to the Dalai Lama, from Ram Dass to the revered Native American elders, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi is himself one of the great spiritual leaders of our time.

He passed away in July 2014.<i>Starred Review.</i> Whether by birth, by marriage or by choice, whether practicing or not, virtually anyone remotely affiliated with Judaism should read this book. Schachter-Shalomi, a founder and leader of the Jewish Renewal movement, offers a Judaism with a keen sense of the present infused with the sacredness of the past, yet written with a hopeful eye toward the future. Sharing his own struggles with faith, Schachter-Shalomi reminds readers that not only is it okay to question God, as Jews it's expected. More than a book, his dialogue takes on the tone of a late Shabbos afternoon in his study. His combination of rich, illustrative Hasidic tales interspersed with probing questions for today and creative suggestions for bringing Judaism into the world reach out to Jews of all ages and virtually all denominations. He addresses prayer, reminding readers that the act of praying is not about the words but about the feeling, and that they should pray from the heart, not by rote. He celebrates diversity, within and among religions, eschewing triumphalism. Most importantly, he offers a path for return to the oneness God intended when he created human beings&#x2014;oneness with ourselves, the world, each other and ultimately with God. <i>(Mar. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <b>The Iraq War</b><i>, </i>John Keegan offers a sharp and lucid appraisal of the military campaign, explaining just how the coalition forces defeated an Iraqi army twice its size and addressing such questions as whether Saddam Hussein ever possessed weapons of mass destruction and how it is possible to fight a war that is not, by any conventional measure, a war at all.<br><br>Drawing on exclusive interviews with Donald Rumsfeld and General Tommy Franks, Keegan retraces the steps that led to the showdown in Iraq, from the highlights of Hussein&#x2019;s murderous rule to the diplomatic crossfire that preceded the invasion. His account of the combat in the desert is unparalleled in its grasp of strategy and tactics. The result is an urgently needed and up-to-date book that adds immeasurably to our understanding of those twenty-one days of war and their long, uncertain aftermath.</p><p>John Keegan is recognized as one of the top military writers of his day, having authored comprehensive analyses of both World Wars and other significant historical events. In <i>The Iraq War</i>, he takes on a situation that was still murky and volatile at the time of publication. The result is a book rich with detailed information on the region and its key figures but somewhat hasty in its effort to provide a succinct history lesson. In the opening chapter, Keegan writes "The war was not only successful but peremptorily short, lasting only twenty-one days from 20 March to 9 April," and he later gives little mention to the protracted and amorphous violence in the region since Baghdad fell, characterizing as "aftermath" that which many see as the actual war itself. Between these sections, however, Keegan provides valuable insight into the geopolitical history of the region and provides an extensive biography of a ruler of whom most Westerners became aware only in the early 1990s: Saddam Hussein. Keegan presents Saddam as a brutal thug who is also possessed of a powerful and vicious political savvy, and charts his growth from Ba'ath Party muscleman to ruler of Iraq. Sections on the military efforts of the U.S. and British forces are extensively detailed and offer insight into not only what the plans of the coalition forces were but the strategic philosophies behind them as well. Keegan characterizes the war as "mysterious," seeking to understand why opposition forces seemed to disappear from active combat and why the citizens of Iraq paid the conflict little regard. And while such mysteries have not yet been solved, it is clear given the ongoing instability in Iraq that the final chapters of the Iraq War have yet to be written. <i>--John Moe</i>Author of the acclaimed "The Face of Battle, and, most recently, "Intelligence in War, John Keegan now brings his extraordinary expertise to bear on perhaps the most controversial war of our time. <br>"<br>The Iraq War is an urgently needed, up-to-date and informed study of the ongoing conflict. In exclusive interviews with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General Tommy Franks, Keegan has gathered information about the war that adds immeasurably to our grasp of its causes, complications, costs and consequences. He probes the reasons for the invasion and delineates the strategy of the American and British forces in capturing Baghdad; he examines the quick victory over the Republican Guard and the more tenacious and deadly opposition that has taken its place. He then analyzes the intelligence information with which the Bush and Blair administrations convinced their respective governments of the need to go to war, and which has since been strongly challenged in both countries. And he makes clear that despite the uncertainty about weapons of mass destruction, regime change, and the use and misuse of intelligence, the war in Iraq is an undeniably formidable display of American power. <br>"The Iraq War is authoritative, timely and vitally important to our understanding of a conflict whose full ramifications are as yet unknown.</p><h2>Handa&#39;s Surprise</h2><p>In this board book edition of a picture book classic, a delightful surprise colourfully unfolds when a little girl called Handa puts seven delicious fruits in a basket to take to her friend.

A car crash killed his brother, Matthias, and critically injured his sister-in-law. It&#x2019;s Sullivan's turn to care for the couple&#x2019;s six children and the ancestral farm, but the die-hard bachelor and art professor is hardly family-man material.

What he gets is pretty Rumer Truehart, a free spirit who will change everything he ever thought he wanted . . . <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Rumer learned the hard way that nothing is for sure, much less forever. And she certainly &nbsp;understands why Sullivan&#x2019;s unhappy childhood makes him a strictly no-commitments kind of guy. But she can't help being drawn to this thoughtful, gentle man. And when trouble strikes, she&#x2019;s determined to win his trust&#x2014;and show him love can be a promise for keeps.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Shirlee McCoy&#x2019;s <i>Sweet Haven</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Fans of Debbie Macomber will appreciate McCoy&#x2019;s sweet, funny, heartwarming romance with its friendly, small-town setting.&#x201d;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;--<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;&#x201c;A delicious small-town treat.&#x201d; <i>--Library Journal</i></b></p><p><b>Shirlee McCoy </b>spent her childhood making up stories and acting them out with her sister.

Visitors after dark are strongly urged to call ahead.PROLOGUE<br> &nbsp;<br> Assilois apVain lounged in his workstation in the dimly lit control room, keeping an eye on the bank of screens that nearly surrounded him. His screens, and those at four other workstations, glowing with real-time images that ranged the spectrum from gamma to radio, provided the room&#x2019;s only illumination. A few of the screens showed pictures easily intelligible to any human eye. Most of them showed shifting schematics, writhing eddies, images in unreal colors, or moving graphs. A few showed rippling, particolored curtains.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only two of the sites in the normally crowded control center were occupied. Everyone else, other than the few people needed to maintain the systems, was at the holiday gala hosted by Dr. Nikholas Morgan. As administrative chief of the exploratory mission to Society 437, Morgan was the de facto head of state. His word was law on Society 437&#x2014;or so he believed. The 846 scientists and technicians at Central, the main scientific station on Waygone&#x2014;which is what everybody but Morgan called the planet&#x2014;had other ideas about who was in charge. The hundred-odd scientists and technicians of the off-site exploratory mission counted themselves lucky that they were posted to Aquarius or Frosty stations and didn&#x2019;t have to put up with Chief Morgan.<br> &nbsp;<br> But two months had passed since Confederation Day, and there hadn&#x2019;t been any holidays or other excuses to break the tedium of work, so Morgan arbitrarily declared a &#x201c;holiday,&#x201d; complete with mandatory attendance at the &#x201c;gala.&#x201d; Division chiefs with field studies and experiments in progress grumbled or howled in agony at Morgan&#x2019;s fiat, but they brought all of their staffs back to Central. Dr. Morgan controlled mission resources; scientists who displeased him found their resources reallocated to someone else.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly apVain sat upright and stared intently at a corner of one of the screens he was monitoring.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do we have a supply run coming in?&#x201d; he asked. When he didn&#x2019;t get an answer, he shot a glance at Suzrain Hirsute, the climatologist at the other workstation. He saw the shimmer of a privacy barrier around Hirsute and so activated the intercom inside Hirsute&#x2019;s workstation and repeated his question.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not that I know of,&#x201d; Hirsute replied absently. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t look up from the atmospheric data he was monitoring.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Someone just dropped into orbit, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; ApVain sounded annoyed. He peered quizzically at the blip on his radar scope. &#x201c;When we set up here, I told Chief Morgan one of the satellites needed to be oriented outward. If we had an all-spectrum satellite looking outward, we would have seen this ship days ago.&#x201d; A surveillance technician, apVain was responsible for geological data via satellite gathering sensors.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nearly all of the satellites in orbit around Society 437 were focused on a section of the planet&#x2019;s surface. Only one of the satellite-borne radars scanned from horizon to horizon, and just then it showed an unexpected blip in orbit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm? What&#x2019;d you say?&#x201d; Hirsute asked as he continued to monitor the atmospheric data.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Someone just dropped into orbit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hirsute looked at apVain and blinked rapidly. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s due for two months. Are you sure?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; apVain snapped. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d; He pointed an accusing finger at the scope.<br> &nbsp;<br> The climatologist levered himself out of his chair and joined apVain to look over his shoulder at the radar scope. Clearly visible just above the horizon was a blip against the black of space.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you sure that&#x2019;s not one of the other satellites?&#x201d; Hirsute asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> ApVain tapped the screen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s at a higher altitude than our satellites. And it&#x2019;s too big. It&#x2019;s a starship, not a satellite.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ApVain shook his head and reached for his comm unit. He was going to give Morgan a piece of his mind for not alerting him to the arrival of an unscheduled ship.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; Hirsute asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was what?&#x201d; ApVain looked back at the scope.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There was a blip, right here.&#x201d; Hirsute touched the screen. Numbers were vanishing from the screen where he pointed. &#x201c;It suddenly appeared, moved a short distance, then vanished.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; apVain said. Hirsute was pointing well below the altitude of the satellites. But as apVain looked, a blip appeared and vanished in a different spot, much closer to Central Station. &#x201c;What the&#x2014;&#x201d; ApVain leaned forward, as though getting closer to the screen would give him more data. He made quick mental calculations from the numbers that had flashed next to the blip. &#x201c;If that continues on the same course, it&#x2019;ll land near here in half an hour.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;But it can&#x2019;t be. There&#x2019;s nothing that appears and vanishes on radar like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could it be the thing I saw?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ApVain shook his head. &#x201c;Too far away&#x2014;nothing moves that fast in atmosphere.&#x201d; His fingers started tapping out Chief Morgan&#x2019;s code on his comm unit, then apVain stopped and stared at the scope again. A smaller blip dropped out of and curved away from the orbiting starship. He put the comm unit down and tapped keys on the radar control board. New numbers scrolled across the screen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That starship just dropped a shuttle on course to land at Aquarius Station. Why would a starship drop someone on Aquarius instead of coming to Central first?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hirsute thought about it for a moment. He swallowed and croaked, &#x201c;Pirates. Only pirates would go to an outstation instead of landing at the main settlement.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh hell.&#x201d; ApVain snatched up his comm unit and frantically tapped out Chief Morgan&#x2019;s code.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before he finished, another blip appeared, far too close to be the same object headed for Aquarius Station.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s landing here!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But they haven&#x2019;t signaled us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ApVain scrabbled at his console controls. He brought up the visual from the surveillance camera outside the control center just as something struck it and the picture dissolved into static. Frantic, he fumbled with his comm unit and tapped in the numbers again. &#x201c;Chief,&#x201d; he said when his call was answered, &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ve got trouble. Looks like there&#x2019;s a starship in orbit; a shuttle is headed toward Aquarius and someone just landed here.&#x201d; His jaw clenched as he listened to Morgan&#x2019;s reply. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not playing some kind of practical joke,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;They just came in out of nowhere. No signals, no nothing. Someone is here. They might be pirates.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly the starship in orbit just disappeared from the screen and the satellites registered a huge explosion.<br> &nbsp;<br> As apVain was explaining that the starship appeared to have been destroyed, the door to the control center slammed open and the two men jerked their attention to it. Hirsute&#x2019;s scream was cut short, becoming a gurgle as he collapsed.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Jan Groover</h2><p>The exhibition catalogue for a traveling show that originated at MoMA, NY, in 1987, presenting the photography of Jan Groover.

H. Richardson's Allegheny Courthouse and Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater.&nbsp; <br><br>With accessible prose, Toker examines Pittsburgh in its historical context (from Indian settlement to postmodern city), in its regional setting (from the playgrounds of the Laurel Highlands to the hard-working mill towns dotting the landscape), and from the street level (leading the reader on a personal tour through every neighborhood).&nbsp; Lavishly illustrated with photos and maps, <i>Pittsburgh: A New Portrait </i>reveals the true colors of a truly great American city.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Franklin Toker is professor of the history of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh, and past president of the Society of Architectural Historians.&nbsp; He is the author of numerous books, including the definitive work on Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, <i>Fallingwater Rising</i>, and <i>Buildings of Pittsburgh</i> in the prestigious Buildings of the United States series."The book is ambitious and lavish, with vivid photographs and helpful maps. &nbsp;From the glaciers that built the town and the epidemics and fires that reshaped it, to the renaissances that renewed it and the indomitable spirit that sustains it, Pittsburgh is a great American city&#x2014;the 'indispensable American city,' in the words of native son David McCullough.

Instead, the call was from his brother: Jason had been killed in a motorcycle accident. He was twenty-three years old. She had seen him alive just a few weeks earlier.<br><br>Leigh first met Jason at an audition for a tragic play. He was nineteen and troubled and intensely magnetic, a dead ringer for James Dean. Leigh was twenty-two and living at home with her parents, trying to figure out what to do with her young adult life. Within months, they had fallen in love and moved to New Mexico, the &#x201c;Land of Enchantment,&#x201d; a place neither of them had ever been. But what was supposed to be a romantic adventure quickly turned sinister, as Jason&#x2019;s behavior went from playful and spontaneous to controlling and erratic, eventually escalating to violence. Now New Mexico was marked by isolation and the anxiety of how to leave a man she both loved and feared. Even once Leigh moved on to New York, throwing herself into her work, Jason and their time together haunted her.<br><i><br>Land of Enchantment</i> lyrically explores the heartbreaking complexity of why the person hurting you the most can be impossible to leave. With searing honesty and cutting humor, Leigh wrestles with what made her fall in love with someone so destructive and how to grieve a man who wasn&#x2019;t always good to her.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Leigh Stein</b> is the author of the novel <i>The Fallback Plan</i>, which made the &#x201c;highbrow brilliant&#x201d; quadrant of <i>New York</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;Approval Matrix,&#x201d; as well as a collection of poetry, <i>Dispatch from the Future</i>, selected for <i>Publishers Weekly</i>&#x2019;s Best Summer Books of 2012 list, in addition to the Rumpus Poetry Book Club.

We had matching leather jackets for when we rode through the desert, two silhouettes against the night. In a box somewhere I still had my helmet, a souvenir from the woman I was when we were together.</p><p>It was a hot night in late July when I got the news. My new boyfriend had central AC at his apartment, so that&#x2019;s where we were, sitting on the couch with our bare feet propped on an ottoman that doubled as a coffee table. Chinese takeout. Channel surfing. I&#x2019;d stopped the remote on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, a reality show about poor young Traveller women getting married like queens.</p><p>The first time the phone rang, the caller ID said it was Jason, so I didn&#x2019;t pick up. I&#x2019;d been avoiding his calls for the past six weeks, ever since he visited me in Brooklyn and we got in a fight at the Coney Island Mermaid Parade; we got in a fight in Central Park in the rain; we got high and we got drunk and we killed time until he finally flew back to Little Rock and I decided it was really over this time.</p><p>For the past couple of days, Jason had been calling more frequently, so when my phone rang a second time, I wasn&#x2019;t surprised, but this time, it was an unknown number. I let the call go to voice mail. On TV, a housewife was demonstrating how she cleaned her teeth with Clorox, straight from the bottle. I was watching her and my boyfriend Brian was watching me, as I listened to the message. The caller identified himself as Jason&#x2019;s half brother in Birmingham. I recognized the accent they shared, but we&#x2019;d never met, or even spoken before.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; Brian asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He just asked me to call him back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s calling to tell you Jason killed himself,&#x201d; he said, and my stomach dropped&#x2014;not because I thought he might be right, but because Brian had come up with an explanation for the evening&#x2019;s phone calls before I&#x2019;d even begun to wonder if something was wrong.</p><p>I called the number in Birmingham back.</p><p>His brother&#x2019;s voice was calm and unemotional. There was a motorcycle accident. Jason had not &#x201c;made it.&#x201d; For one sweet second, I thought it was a joke. A cruel one, sure, but Jason had never been above cruelty, and it wasn&#x2019;t hard to imagine him coming up with this scenario in order to punish me for refusing his calls. I held my breath and waited to hear his laughter in the background, for him to come on the line and say, Gotchou. Meanwhile, I watched a muted trailer-park bride corset herself into a gown studded with roses made from Swarovski crystal and climb into a black limousine. Why didn&#x2019;t I turn off the TV? It was a Saturday night in late July. Jason had been dead since Thursday.</p><p>When it was clear that no one was waiting in the background, I apologized to his brother for thinking he was Jason and not answering his calls sooner. &#x201c;I decided to stop talking to him . . . recently,&#x201d; I tried to explain.</p><p>&#x201c;I figured as much,&#x201d; he said, not unkindly.</p><p>I promised to look into plane tickets to Little Rock, even though a part of me wondered whether or not I should even go to the funeral. Already I could feel the pins and needles of old insecurities, and didn&#x2019;t want to be there, just one ex-girlfriend among many, queuing up for my turn to say why I thought what we had was so special. <i>I was with him the day he got the motorcycle,</i> I could say. <i>We had matching leather jackets.</i></p><p>After we said good-bye, I borrowed Brian&#x2019;s laptop to Google Jason&#x2019;s name, because if something had really happened, if this wasn&#x2019;t a joke, then proof of it would be online. There wasn&#x2019;t an obituary yet, but I found a memorial page where people were leaving condolences and animated gifs of flickering candles that would never expire. I had the option to &#x201c;sign the memory book&#x201d; or &#x201c;light a candle,&#x201d; but I couldn&#x2019;t even begin to think of any condolences to offer, when I just wanted to be consoled myself. Brian was beside me, but he might as well have been a stranger I&#x2019;d picked up at a bar. We hadn&#x2019;t known each other long enough for him to have heard all the stories of who I was before I met him.</p><p>The only other result I could find on Google was an article in an Arkansas newspaper about Jason: &#x201c;Man accused of stabbing another in brawl.&#x201d; Eleven days before the accident, Jason had been arrested for stabbing a man in the stomach outside a gas station. When the police officer asked about all the blood on the concrete, Jason admitted &#x201c;someone might have gotten cut,&#x201d; and pulled a knife from his pocket.</p><p>In the comments section at the bottom of the article, someone had written &#x201c;SAD DUMB THUGS.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jason stabbed someone,&#x201d; I told Brian, &#x201c;before he died.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; I shook my head, trying to clear it. This was the kind of violent act that I always knew he was capable of, and that I used to worry I would be the victim of. I didn&#x2019;t know what kind of woman that made me, if I still loved and missed a man like that. If I still wanted him to come back.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Pin-Pen Switch<br><br>(2007)<br>Jason and I met at an audition for a tragedy. It was late February, and all of Chicago was blanketed in snow. I&#x2019;d come prepared with a monologue, but the assistant director asked if I wouldn&#x2019;t mind also reading a scene&#x2014;there was one guy left who<br>didn&#x2019;t have a partner.</p><p>Approaching me, Jason smiled, and then looked at the floor. He was tall and athletic, wearing jeans and a gray T-shirt that read BRUCE LEE IS MY HOMEBOY over a thermal under- shirt. He looked like the popular jock from every teen movie; I could imagine a slow-motion shot of him walking along a wall of lockers with his arm around a girl. Under any other circumstances, I wouldn&#x2019;t have even known how to start a conversation with him. He would have been the one to come up to me, to ask if he could borrow my Geometry homework.</p><p>I introduced myself and said I was auditioning for Medea, who was he auditioning for?</p><p>He said his name was Jason, but he didn&#x2019;t know what the play was about; he just auditioned for whatever the drama department offered.</p><p>&#x201c;Jason is Medea&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Like Jason and the Argonauts?&#x201d; He stared at me. I babbled on: &#x201c;Basically, he leaves his wife for this rich princess, and so Medea gets revenge by murdering their children and riding off in a chariot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-two. How old are you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How old do you think I am?&#x201d;</p><p>I guessed twenty-one, but he wouldn&#x2019;t say if I was right or wrong.</p><p>We found an empty stairwell where we could run lines, but it was hard to get started. Up close, Jason&#x2019;s skin glowed soft and golden. His eyes were sea-glass green. He had a slightly upturned Irish nose and a default sneer that bloomed into a bright, disarming smile when I said or did something amusing. Each time the sides of our arms or legs brushed against each other, I felt a pinch of pleasure, the sting of wanting more. I made myself stare at the script in my lap.</p><p>&#x201c;So why do you know so much about this play?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;When I was nineteen, I moved to New York to go to acting school,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I love Greek tragedy. My monologue is from <i>Alcestis</i>,&#x201d; I said, eager to impress him with where I&#x2019;d been and what I&#x2019;d done in order to distract him from what I looked like.</p><p>With my round, moony face, protruding elfish ears, and plain dark hair I never styled, there wasn&#x2019;t a chance I was in his league. My expressive eyes were my only good feature, and I&#x2019;d lined them in black for the audition. Self-conscious about weighing twenty pounds more than I had in high school, I hadn&#x2019;t taken off my clothes for anyone in a year&#x2014;not since I&#x2019;d dated my thirty-six-year-old manager, who told me I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to mention our relationship to anyone at the restaurant where we worked, and then stopped returning my phone calls after I told him I was a virgin. For a year I&#x2019;d been kicking myself. Why hadn&#x2019;t I just kept my mouth shut and let him give me what I wanted? At twenty-two, my virginity was something I had to get rid of, fast, or it would be too late for me.</p><p>The more Jason smiled at me, or laughed at things I said, the more it seemed like we were flirting with each other, but I didn&#x2019;t trust my own assessment of the situation. Maybe Jason was gay. It made more sense that an attractive gay man would find me funny and smart than it did for an attractive straight man to be interested in me.</p><p>Eventually we read through the script a couple of times. In the scene, Medea is confronting Jason after he has abandoned her and their children and taken a new wife.</p><p><i>You did well / To come, she says, for I can speak ill of you and lighten / My heart, and you will suffer while you are listening.</i> Then Medea proceeds to recap their love story: first she saved his life from some fire-breathing bulls, then she slew the dragon guarding the Golden Fleece so that Jason could capture it and win the throne of Iolcus. When Pelias, king of Iolcus, went back on his word and wouldn&#x2019;t give it up, Medea tricked his daughters into killing their own father. To Jason, she says bitterly, <i>This is how I behaved to you, you wretched man, / And you forsook me, took another bride to bed.</i></p><p>While we waited for our turn to see the director, I followed him outside for a cigarette break. There&#x2019;d been a blizzard the night before, with forty-mile-an-hour winds and lightning that shot its way east from Iowa&#x2014;the first &#x201c;thundersnow&#x201d; storm since 1891, the forecasters said. I was at my friend Vadim&#x2019;s house- warming party when it started to hail, and spent the night so I wouldn&#x2019;t kill myself driving home. Vadim was a sweet, tall, handsome, talented, brilliant guy. More important, he adored me. So what was my problem? Why couldn&#x2019;t I just fall in love with him? My parents were baffled. For whatever reason, I felt compelled to chase the difficult (an acting career) and the forbid- den (the relationship with my manager). All night I stared at the ceiling in Vadim&#x2019;s bedroom&#x2014;he took the couch&#x2014;trying to recalibrate my feelings so that this night could be the beginning of our future together. It didn&#x2019;t work. By morning, I was so tired and grumpy from having slept wearing my contact lenses that I considered skipping the audition entirely. But here I was, standing out- side in the cold, wide-awake.</p><p>Jason gestured toward the dark, snowy landscape beyond. &#x201c;I did all this,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You made it snow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I work for the school, landscaping the grounds.&#x201d; I noticed his work boots.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t a smoker, but I asked for a Marlboro, just to prolong the time we spent out there, away from everyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you come from?&#x201d; I asked. Jason didn&#x2019;t sound, or dress, like any of the guys I&#x2019;d gone to high school, or acting school, with.</p><p>&#x201c;Alabama. Arkansas. Tennessee.&#x201d; He inhaled. &#x201c;I was All- State wrestling in Tennessee in high school. We moved around a lot for my stepdad&#x2019;s job. In Corpus Christi I could hold bread in my hands by the water and birds would come and get it. But my dad lives here.&#x201d; <i>Birds would come and git it</i>. Jason said<i> git</i> for get and pin for pen and did for dead. In dialect studies, this is called the pin-pen switch. Gold star, Leigh, I thought to myself. What are you going to do with that information?</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t usually get along with people,&#x201d; I blurted out, trying to put into words what I sensed we might have in common. The truth was I got along with everybody, but there was a disconnect between my outgoing Midwestern cheerfulness and the nagging feeling that I was different, strange, destined to live somewhere other than the place I had come from.</p><p>&#x201c;Me either,&#x201d; Jason said. &#x201c;What are you doing later?&#x201d;</p><p>I have almost completely forgotten our actual audition in front of the director, but I remember every beat of our time in the cold, the color and texture of his coat when I stood close, what his face looked like when he was blowing smoke.</p><p>When the audition was over, I called my mom and told her<br>I had met someone and would be home late.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, Leigh,&#x201d; she said. I was living at home in the suburbs with my parents again, for the third time as an adult, after buckling under the stress of trying to piece together a living in New York (twice), and then losing my sublet in Chicago. Some of my friends in New York had parents who paid their expenses while they &#x201c;figured things out.&#x201d; I had parents who let me move back into my childhood bedroom while I did the same. When Jason told me he lived alone, I was impressed.</p><p>First we drove to the supermarket to get some groceries. </p><p>&#x201c;You make me really nervous,&#x201d; Jason said in the pasta aisle.</p><p>I made<i> him </i>nervous? &#x201c;Wait, why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re pretty and nice and smart. Can I hold your hand?&#x201d;</p><p>I gave it to him. Mine was cold and his was warm. The middle- aged checkout ladies smiled at us; they all knew his name. I felt like I&#x2019;d been cast in some role I&#x2019;d never even dreamed of playing.</p><p>We drove back to his apartment and had a snowball fight in the soft yellow light of the parking lot, laughing and pushing each other into snowbanks. Once inside, I borrowed a pair of clean socks because the snow had soaked through my boots, and he cleared the bedding from the couch. He told me that&#x2019;s where he slept every night, instead of the bed, because it was less lonely in there with the TV on.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you like Kool-Aid?&#x201d;</p><p>I had to think about it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if I&#x2019;ve had it since I was eight,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>For dinner, he cooked penne Alfredo with Rag� sauce from a jar, and stirred a pitcher of blue Kool-Aid. Then we made out on the couch for a while. The Oscars played in the background; we pretended we were watching.</p><p>Every time I moved back in with my parents, I had an escape plan, and this time was no different: I was working on my application to a directing program at a theater school in Montreal. <i>This will be perfect</i>, I thought. <i>We can have snowball fights and fool around until I move to Canada.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a Facebook?&#x201d; he asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Friend me.&#x201d;</p><p>By the time I got home that night, he had removed his date of birth from his profile, so I wouldn&#x2019;t know he was only eighteen years old. I turned off my phone and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day, there was a voice mail from him, left in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Leigh,&#x201d; the message said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t actually hate spending time with you. We should go out sometime. Okay, bye.&#x201d;</p><p>When I called back he said he&#x2019;d stayed up late Googling me and reading my poems. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re very . . . Jewish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Jewish&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jewish,&#x201d; he repeated.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I know which one you read. . . .&#x201d; The poem that begins, Miriam danced in Exodus while the Red Sea drowned the horses. . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Can you look at my English paper that&#x2019;s due in an hour and twelve minutes?&#x201d;</p><p>Was he serious? &#x201c;I have to go to work,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll e-mail you the outline now and you can look at the real paper later. What are you doing this weekend? Want to go out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I just asked you out,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;And I said, &#x2018;Sure.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>After we hung up, I wrote in my diary, There must be something horribly wrong with him I haven&#x2019;t discovered yet.</p></p><h2>Army Memoirs of Lucius W.

Motion Picture starring Sean Connery.<br>At first report Matt Cowart doesn't believe the claims of innocence from Robert Earl Ferguson, Death Row inmate. But the more Coward digs into his case, the more he believes that, as a black man, Ferguson is a victim of hate and prejudice, and that the wrong man is going to be executed. Cowart lets fly a series of hard-hitting investigative articles that ultimately frees Ferguson and gets Cowart a Pulitzer Prize. He's a hero, a celebrity, a big-hearted guy--who has unwittingly set in motion a scenario of horror and death....</p><p><b>John Katzenbach</b> is the author of psychological thrillers including <i>Red 1-2-3, What Comes Next, The Traveler, Day of Reckoning,</i> and <i>The Shadow Man</i>. Katzenbach was a criminal court reporter for the <i>Miami Herald</i> and <i>Miami News</i>. He now lives in western Massachusetts.A seen-it-all Miami crime reporter, Matthew Cowart, reopens the case of an inmate waiting on backwoods Florida's death row to be executed for the sex murder of young Joanie Shriver and succeeds in overturning his conviction--only to have his own worst nightmares come true. The convicted killer--a sharp black college student named Robert Earl Ferguson--not only tells Cowart the grounds on which he ought to be sprung (a confession was beaten out of him by local officers Tanny Brown and Bruce Wilcox; his elderly court-appointed lawyer never called his grandmother to give him an alibi; a key witness was told he'd been arrested before she was asked to identify his car), but he also gives Cowart the name of the real killer: hated fellow inmate Blair Sullivan, slated for execution for his own killing spree. And Sullivan (who's obviously spent some time with The Silence of the Lambs) toys with Cowart in several creepy scenes before revealing to him the location of the murder weapon in the Shriver case, and then, on the eve of Ferguson's hearing, sends a letter to the girl's parents exulting in the killing. Sensation: Ferguson is released; Cowart wins a Pulitzer; and Sullivan, one more murder to his credit, goes to the chair--but not before a pair of new murders suggest that Ferguson and Sullivan may have cooked up the whole scheme between them. From here on in it's familiar territory for psycho-baiter Katzenbach (The Traveler, 1987; Day of Reckoning, 1989, etc.), as Cowart closes ranks with Tanny Brown and rookie Keys Det. Andrea Shaeffer (hot on Cowart's tail to find out what he knows about those last two murders) to smoke out Ferguson from his lair in Newark before his next lecture/killing tour of the Florida panhandle. So grossly overextended that you'll see every twist coming pages away--but Katzenbach does keep the suspense mounting from the gloomy opening to the cartoonish denouement. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

My eyes struggled to track the object through a series of increasingly fast, impossibly sharp turns that would have juiced a human being, had there been any aboard. The disc streaked toward the distant horizon, then came to an instantaneous stop just above it. It hovered there motionless over the distant tree line for a few seconds, as if scanning the area beneath it with an invisible beam, before it abruptly launched itself skyward again, making another series of physics-defying changes to its course and speed.<br><br>I tried to keep my cool. I tried to remain skeptical. I reminded myself that I was a man of science, even if I did usually get a C in it.<br><br>I looked at it again. I still couldn&#x2019;t tell what it was, but I knew what it wasn&#x2019;t--it wasn&#x2019;t a meteor. Or a weather balloon, or swamp gas, or ball lightning. No, the unidentified flying object I was staring at with my own two eyes was most definitely not of this earth.<br><br>My first thought was: Holy fucking shit.<br><br>Followed immediately by: I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s finally happening.<br><br>You see, ever since the first day of kindergarten, I had been hoping and waiting for some mind-blowingly fantastic, world-altering event to finally shatter the endless monotony of my public education. I had spent hundreds of hours gazing out at the calm, conquered suburban landscape surrounding my school, silently yearning for the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse, a freak accident that would give me super powers, or perhaps the sudden appearance of a band of time-traveling kleptomaniac dwarves.<br><br>I would estimate that approximately one-third of these dark daydreams of mine had involved the unexpected arrival of beings from another world.<br><br>Of course, I&#x2019;d never believed it would really happen. Even if alien visitors did decide to drop by this utterly insignificant little blue-green planet, no self-respecting extraterrestrial would ever pick my hometown of Beaverton, Oregon--aka Yawnsville, USA--as their point of first contact. Not unless their plan was to destroy our civilization by wiping out our least interesting locales first. If there was a bright center to the universe, I was on the planet it was farthest from. Please pass the blue milk, Aunt Beru.<br><br>But now something miraculous was happening here--it was still happening, right now! There was a goddamn flying saucer out there. I was staring right at it.<br><br>And I was pretty sure it was getting closer.<br><br>I cast a furtive glance back over my shoulder at my two best friends, Cruz and Diehl, who were both seated behind me. But they were currently engaged in a whispered debate and neither of them was looking toward the windows. I considered trying to get their attention, but I was worried the object might vanish any second, and I didn&#x2019;t want to miss my chance to see this for myself.<br><br>My gaze shot back outside, just in time to see another bright flash of silver as the craft streaked laterally across the landscape, then halted and hovered over an adjacent patch of terrain before zooming off again. Hover, move. Hover, move.<br><br>It was definitely getting closer. I could see its shape in more detail now. The saucer banked sideways for a few seconds, and I got my first clear glimpse of its top-down profile, and I saw that it wasn&#x2019;t really a saucer at all. From this angle, I could see that its symmetrical hull resembled the blade of a two-headed battle-axe, and that a black, octagonal prism lay centered between its long, serrated wings, glinting in the morning sunlight like a dark jewel.<br><br>That was when I felt my brain begin to short-circuit, because there was no mistaking the craft&#x2019;s distinctive design. After all, I&#x2019;d seen it almost every night for the past few years, through a targeting reticle. I was looking at a Sobrukai Glaive, one of the fighter ships piloted by the alien bad guys in Armada, my favorite videogame.<br><br>Which was, of course, impossible. Like seeing a TIE Fighter or a Klingon Warbird cruising across the sky. The Sobrukai and their Glaive Fighters were fictional videogame creations. They didn&#x2019;t exist in the real world--they couldn&#x2019;t. In reality, videogames did not come to life and fictional spaceships did not buzz your hometown. Implausible shit like that only happened in cheesy &#x2019;80s movies, like TRON or WarGames or The Last Starfighter. The sorts of movies my late father had been nuts about.<br><br>The gleaming craft banked sideways again, and this time I got an even better look--there was no doubt about it. I was looking at a Glaive, right down to the distinctive claw-like grooves along its fuselage and the twin plasma cannons protruding from the front end like two fangs.<br><br>There was only one logical explanation for what I was seeing. I had to be hallucinating. And I knew what sort of people suffered from hallucinations in broad daylight without any help from drugs or alcohol. People who were cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, that&#x2019;s who. Cats with a serious marble deficiency.<br><br>I&#x2019;d long wondered if my father had been one such person, because of what I&#x2019;d read in one of his old journals. The things I&#x2019;d seen there had given me the impression that he&#x2019;d become somewhat delusional near the end of his life. That he may have even lost the ability to differentiate between videogames and reality--the very same problem I now seemed to be experiencing myself. Maybe it was just as I had always secretly feared: The apple had fallen right next to the Crazy Tree.<br><br>Had I been drugged? No, impossible. All I&#x2019;d eaten that morning was a raw strawberry Pop-Tart I&#x2019;d wolfed down in my car on the way to school--and the only thing crazier than hallucinating a fictional videogame spaceship would be to blame it on a frosted breakfast pastry. Especially if I knew my own DNA was a far more likely culprit.<br><br>This was my own fault, I realized. I could&#x2019;ve taken precautions. But instead, I&#x2019;d done the opposite. Like my old man, I&#x2019;d spent my entire life overdosing on uncut escapism, willingly allowing fantasy to become my reality. And now, like my father before me, I was paying the price for my lack of vision. I was going off the rails on a crazy train. You could practically hear Ozzy screaming &#x201c;All aboard!&#x201d;<br><br>Don&#x2019;t do this, I pleaded with myself. Don&#x2019;t crack up now, when we&#x2019;ve only got two months to go until graduation! This is the home stretch, Lightman! Keep it together!<br><br>Outside the window, the Glaive Fighter streaked laterally again. As it zoomed over a cluster of tall trees, I saw their branches rustle in its wake. Then it zipped through another cloud bank, moving so fast it punched a perfect circular hole through its center, dragging several long wisps of cloud vapor along with it as it tore out the other side.<br><br>A second later, the craft froze in midair one last time before it streaked straight upward in a silver blur, vanishing from sight as quickly as it had appeared.<br><br>I just sat there for a moment, unable to do more than stare at the empty patch of sky where it had been a second earlier. Then I glanced around at the other students seated nearby. No one else was looking in the direction of the windows. If that Glaive Fighter had really been out there, no one else had seen it.<br><br>I turned back and scanned the empty sky once again, praying for the strange silver craft to reappear. But it was long gone, and now here I was, forced to deal with the aftermath.<br><br>Seeing that Glaive Fighter, or imagining I&#x2019;d seen it, had triggered a small rock slide in my mind that was already growing into a crushing avalanche of conflicting emotions and fragmented memories--all of them linked to my father, and that old journal I&#x2019;d found among his things.<br><br>Actually, I wasn&#x2019;t even sure it had been a journal. I&#x2019;d never finished reading it. I&#x2019;d been too disturbed by its contents, and what they&#x2019;d seemed to imply about the author&#x2019;s mental state. So I&#x2019;d put the old notebook back where I found it and tried to forget that it even existed--and until a few seconds ago, I had succeeded.<br><br>But now I couldn&#x2019;t seem to think about anything else.<br><br>I felt a sudden compulsion to run out of the school, drive home, and find it. It wouldn&#x2019;t take long. My house was only a few minutes away.<br><br>I glanced over at the exit, and the man guarding it, Mr. Sayles, our elderly Integrated Mathematics II teacher. He had a silver buzz cut, thick horn-rimmed glasses, and wore the same monochromatic outfit he always did: black loafers, black slacks, a white short-sleeve dress shirt, and a black clip-on necktie. He&#x2019;d been teaching at this high school for over forty-five years now, and the old yearbook photos in the library were proof that he&#x2019;d been rocking this same retro ensemble the entire time. Mr. S was finally retiring this year, which was a good thing, because he appeared to have run out of shits to give sometime in the previous century. Today, he&#x2019;d spent the first five minutes going over our homework assignment, then given us the rest of the period to work on it, while he shut off his hearing aid and did his crosswords. But he would still spot me if I tried to sneak out.<br><br>My eyes moved to the ancient clock embedded in the lime green brick wall above the obsolete chalkboard. With its usual lack of pity, it informed me there were still thirty-two minutes remaining until the bell.<br><br>There was no way I could take thirty-two more minutes of this. After what I&#x2019;d just seen, I&#x2019;d be lucky if I managed to keep my shit together for another thirty-two seconds.<br><br>Off to my left, Douglas Knotcher was currently engaged in his daily humiliation of Casey Cox, the shy, acne-plagued kid unfortunate enough to be seated in front of him. Knotcher usually limited himself to lobbing verbal insults at the poor guy, but today he&#x2019;d decided to go old-school and lob spitballs at him instead. Knotcher had a stack of moist projectiles piled on his desk like cannonballs, and he was currently firing them at the back of Casey&#x2019;s head, one after another. The back of the poor kid&#x2019;s hair was already damp with spit from Knotcher&#x2019;s previous attacks. A couple of Knotcher&#x2019;s pals were watching from the back of the room, and they snickered each time he nailed Casey with another projectile, egging him on.<br><br>It drove me nuts when Knotcher bullied Casey like this--which, I suspected, was one of the reasons Knotcher enjoyed doing it so much. He knew I couldn&#x2019;t do a damn thing about it.<br><br>I glanced at Mr. Sayles, but he was still lost in his crossword, clueless as always--a fact that Knotcher took advantage of on a daily basis. And on a daily basis, I had to resist the urge to knock his teeth down his throat.<br><br>Doug Knotcher and I had managed to avoid each other, for the most part, ever since &#x201c;the Incident&#x201d; back in junior high. Until this year, when a cruel act of fate had landed us both in the same math class. Seated in adjacent rows, no less. It was almost as if the universe wanted my last semester of high school to be as hellish as possible.<br><br>That would have also explained why my ex-girlfriend, Ellen Adams, was in this class, too. Three rows to my right and two rows back, sitting just beyond the reach of my peripheral vision.<br><br>Ellen was my first love, and we&#x2019;d lost our virginity to each other. It had been nearly two years since she&#x2019;d dumped me for some wrestler from a neighboring school, but every time I saw those freckles across the bridge of her nose--or caught sight of her tossing that curly red hair out of her eyes--I felt my heart breaking all over again. I usually spent the entire class period trying to forget she was in the room.<br><br>Being forced to sit between my mortal enemy and my ex-girlfriend every afternoon made seventh-period math feel like my own private Kobayashi Maru, a brutal no-win scenario designed to test my emotional fortitude.<br><br>Thankfully fate had balanced out the nightmare equation slightly by placing my two best friends in this class, too. If Cruz and Diehl hadn&#x2019;t been assigned here, I probably would&#x2019;ve snapped and started hallucinating shit midway through my first week.<br><br>I glanced back at them again. Diehl, who was tall and thin, and Cruz, who was short and stocky, both shared the same first name, Michael. Ever since grade school I had been calling them by their last names to avoid confusion. The Mikes were still engaged in the same whispered conversation they&#x2019;d been having earlier, before I&#x2019;d zoned out and started seeing things--a debate over the &#x201c;coolest melee weapon in the history of cinema.&#x201d; I tried to focus in on their voices again now.<br><br>&#x201c;Sting wasn&#x2019;t even really a sword,&#x201d; Diehl was saying. &#x201c;It was more like a glow-in-the-dark Hobbit butter knife, used to spread jam on scones and lembas bread and shit.&#x201d;<br><br>Cruz rolled his eyes. &#x201c; &#x2018;Your love of the halflings&#x2019; leaf has clearly slowed your mind,&#x2019; &#x201d; he quoted. &#x201c;Sting was an Elvish blade, forged in Gondolin in the First Age! It could cut through almost anything! And its blade only glowed when it detected the presence of orcs or goblins nearby. What does Mjolnir detect? Fake accents and frosted hair?&#x201d;<br><br>I wanted to tell them what I&#x2019;d just seen, but best friends or not, there was no way in hell they&#x2019;d believe me. They&#x2019;d think of it as another symptom of their pal Zack&#x2019;s psychological instability.<br><br>And maybe it was, too.<br><br>&#x201c;Thor doesn&#x2019;t need to detect his enemies so he can run off and hide in his little Hobbit hole!&#x201d; Diehl whispered. &#x201c;Mjolnir is powerful enough to destroy mountains, and it can also emit energy blasts, create force fields, and summon lightning. The hammer also always returns to Thor&#x2019;s hand after he throws it, even if it has to tear through an entire planet to get back to him! And only Thor can wield it!&#x201d; He leaned back.<br><br>&#x201c;Dude, Mjolnir is a bullshit magical Swiss Army knife!&#x201d; Cruz said. &#x201c;Even worse than Green Lantern&#x2019;s ring! They give that hammer a new power every other week, just to get Thor out of whatever asinine fix they&#x2019;ve written him into.&#x201d; He smirked. &#x201c;By the way, lots of other people have wielded Mjolnir, including Wonder Woman in a crossover issue! Google it! Your whole argument is invalid, Diehl!&#x201d;</p><h2>Medicine Hands</h2><p>A practical book written for both health professionals and the lay person, this guide deconstructs the myths about massage and cancer.</p><p>Gayle MacDonald, M.S., L.M.T, a long time health educator and veteran massage therapist, finds that her personal and professional interests are inseparable.

Her great-granddaughter Adelaide, the current matriarch of Holly Oak, doesn't believe that Susannah's ghost haunts the antebellum mansion looking for a pardon, but rather the house itself bears a grudge toward its tragic past.</p><p>When Marielle Bishop marries into the family and is transplanted from the arid west to her husband's home, it isn't long before she is led to believe that the house she just settled into brings misfortune to the women who live there.</p><p>With Adelaide's richly peppered superstitions and deep family roots at stake, Marielle must sort out the truth about Susannah Page and Holly Oak - and make peace with the sacrifices she has made for love.</p></p><p><p>Award-winning writer <b>Susan Meissner</b> is a multi-published author, speaker and workshop leader with a background in community journalism. Her novels include <i>The Shape of Mercy</i>, named by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> as one of the Best Books of 2008. She is a pastor&#x2019;s wife and a mother of four. When she's not writing, Susan directs the Small Groups and Connection Ministries program at her San Diego church.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride stood in a circle of Virginia sunlight, her narrow heels clicking on Holly Oak&#x2019;s patio stones as she greeted strangers in the receiving line. Her wedding dress was a simple A-line, strapless, with a gauzy skirt of white that breezed about her knees like lacy curtains at an open window. She had pulled her unveiled brunette curls into a loose arrangement dotted with tiny flowers that she&#x2019;d kept alive on her flight from Phoenix. Her only jewelry was a white topaz pendant at her throat and the band of platinum on her left ring finger. Tall, slender, and tanned from the famed and relentless Arizona sun, hers was a girl-nextdoor look: pretty but not quite beautiful. Adelaide thought it odd that Marielle held no bouquet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the parlor window Adelaide watched as her grandson-in-law, resplendent in a black tuxedo next to his bride, bent toward the guests and greeted them by name, saying, &#x201c;This is Marielle.&#x201d; An explanation seemed ready to spring from his lips each time he shook the hand of someone who had known Sara, her deceased granddaughter. His first wife. Carson stood inches from Marielle, touching her elbow every so often, perhaps to assure himself that after four years a widower he had indeed patently and finally moved on from grief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smatterings of conversations wafted about on the May breeze and into the parlor as received guests strolled toward trays of sweet tea and champagne. Adelaide heard snippets from her place at the window. Hudson and Brette, her great-grandchildren, had moved away from the snaking line of gray suits and pastel dresses within minutes of the first guests&#x2019; arrival and were now studying the flower-festooned gift table under the window ledge, touching the bows, fingering the silvery white wrappings. Above the children, an old oak&#x2019;s youngest branches shimmied to the tunes a string quartet produced from the gazebo beyond the receiving line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide raised a teacup to her lips and sipped the last of its contents, allowing the lemony warmth to linger at the back of her throat. She had spent the better part of the morning readying the garden for Carson and Marielle&#x2019;s wedding reception, plucking spent geranium blossoms, ordering the catering staff about, and straightening the rented linen tablecloths. She needed to join the party now that it had begun. The Blue-Haired Old Ladies would be wondering where she was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her friends had been the first to arrive, coming through the garden gate on the south side of the house at five minutes before the hour. She&#x2019;d watched as Carson introduced them to Marielle, witnessed how they cocked their necks in blue-headed unison to sweetly scrutinize her grandson-in-law&#x2019;s new wife, and heard their welcoming remarks through the open window.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deloris gushed about how lovely Marielle&#x2019;s wedding dress was and what, pray tell, was the name of that divine purple flower she had in her hair?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearl invited Marielle to her bridge club next Tuesday afternoon and asked her if she believed in ghosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxine asked her how Carson and she had met&#x2014;though Adelaide had told her weeks ago that Carson met Marielle on the Internet&#x2014;and why on earth Arizona didn&#x2019;t like daylight-saving time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marielle had smiled, sweet and knowing&#x2014;like the kindergarten teacher who finds the bluntness of five-year-olds endearing&#x2014;and answered the many questions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mojave asters. She didn&#x2019;t know how to play bridge. She&#x2019;d never encountered a ghost so she couldn&#x2019;t really say but most likely not. She and Carson met online. There&#x2019;s no need to save what one has an abundance of. Carson had cupped her elbow in his hand, and his thumb caressed the inside of her arm while she spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide swiftly set the cup down on the table by the window, whisking away the remembered tenderness of that same caress on Sara&#x2019;s arm.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had every right to remarry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara had been dead for four years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned from the bridal tableau outside and inhaled deeply the gardenia-scented air in the parlor. Unbidden thoughts of her granddaughter sitting with her in that very room gently nudged her. Sara at six cutting out paper dolls. Memorizing multiplication tables at age eight. Sewing brass buttons onto gray wool coats at eleven. Sara reciting a poem for English Lit at sixteen, comparing college acceptance letters at eighteen, sharing a chance letter from her estranged mother at nineteen, showing Adelaide her engagement ring at twenty-four. Coming back home to Holly Oak with Carson when Hudson was born. Nursing Brette in that armchair by the fireplace. Leaning against the door frame and telling Adelaide&nbsp;that she was expecting her third child.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right there Sara had done those things while Adelaide sat at the long table in the center of the room, empty now but usually awash in yards of stiff Confederate gray, glistening gold braid, and tiny piles of brass buttons&#x2014;the shining elements of officer reenactment uniforms before they see war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide ran her fingers along the table&#x2019;s polished surface, the warm wood as old as the house itself. Carson had come to her just a few months ago while she sat at that table piecing together a sharpshooter&#x2019;s forest green jacket. He had taken a chair across from her as Adelaide pinned a collar, and he&#x2019;d said he needed to tell her something.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#x2019;d met someone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she&#x2019;d said nothing, he added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been four years, Adelaide.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I know how long it&#x2019;s been.&#x201d; The pins made a tiny plucking sound as their pointed ends pricked the fabric.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She lives in Phoenix.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never been to Phoenix.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mimi.&#x201d; He said the name Sara had given her gently, as a father might. A tender reprimand. He waited until she looked up at him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Sara would want me to live the rest of my life alone. I really don&#x2019;t. And I don&#x2019;t think she would want Hudson and Brette not to have a mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Those children have a mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You know what I mean. They need to be mothered. I&#x2019;m gone all day at work. I only have the weekends with them. And you won&#x2019;t always be here. You&#x2019;re a wonderful great-grandmother, but they need someone to mother them, Mimi.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the pin cushion closer to her and swallowed. &#x201c;I know they do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned forward in his chair. &#x201c;And I...I miss having someone to share my life with. I miss the companionship. I miss being in love. I miss having someone love me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide smoothed the pieces of the collar. &#x201c;So. You are in love?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had taken a moment to answer. &#x201c;Yes. I think I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson hadn&#x2019;t brought anyone home to the house, and he hadn&#x2019;t been on any dates. But he had lately spent many nights after the children were in bed in his study&#x2014;the old drawing room&#x2014;with the door closed. When she&#x2019;d pass by, Adelaide would hear the low bass notes of his voice as he spoke softly into his phone. She knew that gentle sound. She had heard it before, years ago when Sara and Carson would sit in the study and talk about their day. His voice, deep and resonant. Hers, soft and melodic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you going to marry her?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had laughed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you even want to know her name?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not cared at that moment about a name. The specter of being alone in Holly Oak shoved itself forward in her mind. If he remarried, he&#x2019;d likely move out and take the children with him. &#x201c;Are you taking the children? Are you leaving Holly Oak?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Adelaide&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Will you be leaving?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several seconds of silence had hung suspended between them. Carson and Sara had moved into Holly Oak ten years earlier to care for Adelaide after heart surgery and had simply stayed. Ownership of Holly Oak had been Sara&#x2019;s birthright and was now Hudson and Brette&#x2019;s future inheritance. Carson stayed on after Sara died because, in her grief, Adelaide asked him to, and in his grief, Carson said yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Will you be leaving?&#x201d; she asked again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you want me to leave?&#x201d; He sounded unsure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You would stay?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had sat back in his chair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s a good idea to take Hudson and Brette out of the only home they&#x2019;ve known. They&#x2019;ve already had to deal with more than any kid should.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So you would marry this woman and bring her here. To this house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had hesitated only a moment. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew without asking that they were not talking solely about the effects moving would have on a ten-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl. They were talking about the strange biology of their grief. Sara had been taken from them both, and Holly Oak nurtured their common sorrow in the most kind and savage of ways. Happy memories were one way of keeping someone attached to a house and its people. Grief was the other. Surely Carson knew this. An inner nudging prompted her to consider asking him what his new bride would want.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What is her name?&#x201d; she asked instead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered, &#x201c;Marielle...&#x201d;<br></p><h2>Oedipus: The Tragedies (Stephanides Brothers&#39; Greek Mythology)</h2><p>A special pocket-book version of the Greek mythology which has achieved worldwide recognition.

Her website metropolitanorganizing.com receives around 10,000 unique visitors per month. </p><p>About this book </p><p> In recent times, reality TV shows highlighting hoarding tendencies have raised awareness about keeping too much stuff. As a result, decluttering and organizing are now trendy topics. You're with the in-crowd if you've started buying experiences in lieu of material gifts. The travel and hospitality industries are experiencing a boom in business from those who have grown weary of buying more "stuff" to "stuff" in their already "stuffed" homes, and who have cleaned up their calendars to make room for fun. Homeowners are still spending money, but instead of buying knickknacks and whatnots, they're choosing theater tickets, spa treatments and amusement-park passes. </p><p> People are eager to learn how to live with less, practice minimalism and enjoy a less stressful lifestyle. How to declutter and de-stress is the new hot topic that can be brought up in any conversation. It's as if decluttering is a sport, and everyone, regardless of age, income or gender, is welcome to play along and beat clutter. </p><p> This book is a culmination of the best ideas I've learned about decluttering and organizing as both an on- and off-camera organizing expert. My goal in writing this book is to teach you how to transform your casa de C.H.A.O.S (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome) into casa de calm. I want to replace confusion with confidence. Life is better when we live in a well-ordered home that suits our lifestyle and expresses our personality.

THE SILVER AGE OF COMIC BOOK ART highlights the careers of eight acknowledged hall of fame artists who drew definitive versions of the industry&#x2019;s greatest characters, while often setting trends in the look of comic book art itself. Arlen Schumer&#x2019;s book is the first to concentrate on the importance of these artists and their work, as well as the literary and sociological aspects of the Silver Age. Designed by the author using a distinctive graphic style, actual comic book art is enlarged to dynamic full- and double-page spreads, along with biographical text by the author, and thoughts, ideas, and quotes from the artists themselves. Finally, here is an art book that pays proper homage to this great era of comic books and the amazing artists responsible for it.</p><p>ARLEN SCHUMER is one of the foremost historians of comic book art. His articles have appeared in Print Magazine, Comic Book Marketplace, and Comic Book Artist. He has given multimedia presentations for the New York Art Directors Club and designed exhibits for the Words and Pictures Museum in Northampton, Massachusetts. As a co-founder and partner of The Dynamic Duo Studio, Schumer is one of comic book art&#x2019;s most idiosyncratic practitioners.

It was created during the Second World War, and has always been shrouded in secrecy. But people who make missiles and other weapons are regular working people, with domestic routines and everyday dilemmas, and four of them were Karen Piper's parents, her sister, and--when she needed summer jobs--herself. Her dad designed the Sidewinder, which was ultimately used catastrophically in Vietnam. When her mom got tired of being a stay-at-home mom, she went to work on the Tomahawk. Once, when a missile nose needed to be taken offsite for final testing, her mother loaded it into the trunk of the family car, and set off down a Los Angeles freeway. Traffic was heavy, and so she stopped off at the mall, leaving the missile in the parking lot.<br><br>Piper sketches in the belief systems--from Amway's get-rich schemes to propaganda in <i>The Rocketeer</i> to evangelism, along with fears of a Lemurian takeover and Charles Manson--that governed their lives. Her memoir is also a search for the truth of the past and what really brought her parents to China Lake with two young daughters, a story that reaches back to her father's World War II flights with contraband across Europe. Finally, it recounts the crossroads moment in a young woman's life when she finally found a way out of a culture of secrets and fear, and out of the desert.</p><p>Karen Piper is the award-winning author of <i>The Price of Thirst, Left in the Dust,</i> and <i>Cartographic Fictions</i>. She has received the Sierra Nature Writing Award and the Next Generation Indie Book Award and fellowships from the Huntington, Carnegie Mellon, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. She is currently a professor of literature and geography at the University of Missouri.Chapter One<br><br>Born into Missiles<br><br>Don't touch any ordnance," the guide said. "If you see any lying around. It could explode." Fiftyish and portly, he was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and might have passed for a truck driver if not for the B-2 bomber on his cap. Above the plane, the hat read "Northrop," where I assumed he must have worked, maybe even on the B-2. The group of twenty or so tripod-toting tourists, there to photograph the largest collection of petroglyphs in the Western Hemisphere, looked around warily. A few people laughed, others fidgeted. Only my mom and I knew that we really could explode.<br><br>"Ordnance, what's ordnance?" the woman next to me whispered with a plaintive smile as we began our walk into the canyons. One glance at her tripod made me worry. It was almost as tall as her, and she looked wobbly already.<br><br>"Missiles, bombs, that sort of thing," I said. She stopped and stepped back, her smile dropping. What did she expect? I thought. We were at China Lake Naval Weapons Center, after all. Things were supposed to explode.<br><br>I had grown up here, but now only my mother remained behind to keep watch over my father's body in the warm earth. My sister and I had left long ago, and only an old black-and-white photograph of my family in front of some petroglyphs had drawn me back. In the photo, we are all together and happy: my dad, Earl; my mom, Mary; my sister, Christine; and me. I could not remember if the photo had been taken here or during one of our family road trips, hopping from one desert to another. So here I was, trying to remember something about a childhood locked behind the base gates, my memories in files that would never be declassified. I had lost my security clearance, and after my mom retired, our last access was stripped away with the sticker on her car. My family had once roamed these desert ranges freely, but now we were in exile, tourists to our own pasts. The only way we could visit the base was on a petroglyph tour.<br><br>"Don't pick up a missile, Mom," I whispered, leaning over conspiratorially. She just shrugged. She was seventy-four and impish as ever, slightly plump but ever ready to go. With her wispy gray hair, bare face, and polyester pants, she was quintessential China Lake. Not a place for fussing over hair and makeup.<br><br>"I'm not the one I'm worried about," she said, chuckling. I knew she was right. Though once prone to hide behind her skirts, I had become the kind of person whose feet would make a beeline to what I needed to know. Nothing could stop me. I would pick up ordnance just because I had to read the fine print. My mom followed me around as if I were a toddler, hoping to keep me alive.<br><br>Our giggling and whispering brought a swift glance from the man in the B-2 bomber cap. We both looked down, feigning invisibility, and he continued after a pause. In the wispy dead desert grass, I noticed a stinkbug startled by our shuffling feet. It raised its behind into the air, awaiting predators with a different kind of explosion, a stink that would go unnoticed by the giants towering above. I tapped my mom on the arm. "Stinkbug," I said, pointing. She nodded and smiled.<br><br>Located in Southern California�s Mojave Desert, China Lake had been built so rocket scientists could design and detonate weapons in the same place. The spot was chosen for both its emptiness during World War II and its proximity to Pasadena�s California Institute of Technology. The United States Navy claimed to have found the perfect �desert wasteland,� a place with nothing there to kill. Caltech�s rocket scientists could drive two to three hours and blow things up at a safe distance from LA�s suburban sprawl.<br><br>At first, it was all about making rockets better than Hitler's. But after the war, a strange thing happened: China Lake kept growing. It was built to be temporary but had slowly developed a life of its own. Before long, it expanded from a cluster of Quonset huts to an area the size of Rhode Island, more than a million acres in all. Soon seventy-five percent of all "free world conventional weapons"-the non-nuclear, non-communist kind-would be designed at this odd inland navy base. My home.<br><br>The center of the base, where everyone lives, is at the bottom of Indian Wells Valley, though the navy also owns the small desert mountain ranges on three sides-all used as testing sites. On the fourth side, to the west, are the highest peaks in the "lower forty-eight," the Sierra Nevada mountains. Owens Peak is our peak, the tallest we can see. It determines when day and night begins at China Lake. Next to the base town is a large desert playa, the base's namesake: China Lake, named after the Chinese laborers who once mined borax from the lake bed. Outside the dry lake's edges, the valley is blanketed by creosote bushes, which over time form rings of clones to protect the "mother" at the center from the bracing wind. Test pilots say the pattern looks like a bull's-eye, but they're the only ones who get to see the base from above since even the airspace is restricted. There are aerial photographs that show the valley littered with bomb craters and targets like white-painted Xs, fake houses, and old military airplanes, tanks, and railroad cars. Almost anything can be blown up. There is even an old Vietnamese-style bridge left over from that war, half-exploded in the rolling brown hills.<br><br>I grew up in the age of missiles, which are essentially rockets with brains. They can hunt you down and will not just fly off willy-nilly to who-knows-where. If you're lucky, that is. China Lake is famous for its target-tracking missiles, dubbed "smart weapons," though it can be hard to get those missiles to hit their targets, to be as "smart" as they should be. More often than not, they are like errant children. This is why the base's first logo was a cross-eyed jackrabbit riding an out-of-control missile. Nevertheless, the right mixture of a successful missile test, perfect desert blooms, and blue skies will bring a smile to any China Laker's face.<br><br>China Lake is a strange ship in the desert, but it was also my home. Every morning at seven fifteen, my family would drive through the main gate, showing our badges to a U.S. Marine standing outside a closet-sized guardhouse. My dad went to work on the Sidewinder missile-it was his job to make sure it hit its targets-and my mom on the Tomahawk. My sister worked on base inventory, counting circuit boards and bombs. I worked as a secretary as soon as I could drive. Of course, we could not talk about anything we did on the base, even to one another. We lived in secrecy.<br><br>My mom and I walked down into Renegade Canyon as basalt walls closed in on us, blackened with the lichens and molds of age. Into this dark surface were etched images of two-headed bighorn sheep, men with helmet-sized heads, and women with giant earrings and spears.<br><br>"And remember, this is an active bombing range," the bomber man said, as if reading my mind. "Do not get lost." My mom glared at me. Then he added, "But don't worry-they don't bomb the canyon . . . or at least they try not to." He chuckled again. I liked him already.<br><br>As sunshine, desert wildflowers, and cacti flooded my senses, memories came rushing back. The incongruousness of the place made me want to laugh out loud, to become delirious like a Paiute on drugs. I started a skip-run like my father's into the canyon and felt that desert elation seep inside me, the living wilderness embracing me. The guide faded into the distance. The ordnance was forgotten.<br><br>I knew where I was. Home?<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Journey to the Lake<br><br>We made the trip from Seattle to China Lake in our sky-blue Plymouth Valiant, which had more than two hundred thousand miles on it, though we proudly made it last to four hundred thousand. Christine and I sat in the back seat, where I clutched a stack of desert postcards that my dad had sent from China Lake. He had moved there several months before us, while my mom stayed behind to sell the house. Now we were all together again, my dad having flown back to collect us after the house sold. The highway signs read "Fifty-Five Saves Lives" as we began our twenty-hour trek to our new home, my dad in the driver's seat. All I knew about where we were going was from the postcards in my hand. One was covered with paintings of desert animals-jackrabbit, antelope, tarantula, coyote, horny toad-and the other was a photo of a desert tortoise eating small yellow daisies.<br><br>Christine was nine and precocious, with stringy blondish hair and always a bit too skinny. No matter how much she ate, she would not fatten up. I was always bigger and taller, with a twisted brown mop of thick hair. "All you needed to do was shake your beautiful curls and you looked so nice," my mom once told me. "Christine looked nice too, but it took more time." It was enough time to make her hate me, it seemed. She counted the minutes it took to become beautiful, while I grew up effortlessly.<br><br>To counter those unfair minutes, Christine told me I was adopted. She said the proof was my "green" skin, which others might call "an olive complexion." To her, it was absolutely alien, leading to far-reaching ancestral explanations from Gypsy to Italian to Sami. Luckily, my thumbs were flat and wide, like my mother's. They were proof I was not adopted. Even though I had to walk around with my thumbs tucked inside my fists to avoid mockery, at least I knew I belonged. I would not be sent back to the Gypsies or Italians or Laplanders.<br><br>I always knew I was my sister's "usurper," the one who took her place. As my friend Meli, a psychologist, once explained to me, "A child can only survive without constant attention around age three. If a new sibling arrives before then, the first child can feel that her very survival is at stake." Unfortunately, no one told my mother that. Sis and I were two years apart, so I was fit for nothing but murder. "Stine hit me" were my first words, recorded forever in my baby book.<br><br>My dad kept us from fighting in the back seat of that Plymouth by leading us in endless folk ditties. You could stop Christine midpunch with, "Singing, ditty-ah, ditty-ah ding . . ." Outside, the world gradually turned drier and more brown, as if someone had taken a straw to the plants and sucked the water out. "I am going to miss watching our cherry tree bloom," my mom said, sighing, from the passenger seat. Just outside our front door in the Seattle suburb of Newport Hills, that tree had bunches of blossoms so big that they hung down like lanterns. Yet even those blooms were smaller than the giant orchids my mom would wear as corsages on special days such as Easter or Mother's Day. She would look striking with her jet-black hair, pink or yellow tailored suit, and matching pillbox hat with a tiny veil. Her dark pink lipstick would offset the pink of the flowers as she leaned down to me to brush the blossoms on my face. I would giggle at the tickling feel of petals and their rapturous scent. I always associated my mother with the mingled fragrances of cherry blossoms and Chanel No. 5.<br><br>Then, suddenly, her suits were all packed for China Lake and that world was abruptly taken from us, fading into emptiness on our long drive into the desert. Seattle was to be a beautiful cherry blossom-scented ghost. Gone were the glistening, raindrop-covered trees of my childhood and the cloudy days on the beach digging for clams. As we skirted the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains, which towered over us with their snow-covered peaks, the sun stunned with its ferocity and miles of open desert lay ahead of us like a giant pancake. We were left in a daze.<br><br>"Listen to this-" My mom began to read from a guidebook: "'The region surrounding China Lake is rich in the scenic beauty of desert valleys and majestic mountain regions.'" She sounded happy, which made me happy too. "'Death Valley is about ninety and Mount Whitney about eighty miles away, and on every hand are the historic sites of the Old West.'" The base had sent us this little booklet with a picture of Michelson Laboratory on the cover, where my dad had already begun working.<br><br>"Why do they call it Death Valley?" I asked.<br><br>"Pioneers used to die from the heat while trying to cross it in wagon trains a long time ago," she explained. "There are no roads across the Sierras from China Lake. I guess we'll be cut off from the world." My eyes got big, while my sister, who had the practical mind of a scientist, nodded in excitement.<br><br>"It describes why the navy chose this spot. . . ." Her voice rose with piqued interest. "'This nearly uninhabited desert valley, the clear skies and good flying weather, the ample water supply, the accessibility of highway and railroad, and the proximity to the Los Angeles manufacturing area all combined to provide a setting that ideally suited year-round weapon development and testing operations.'" Despite the few details in the guidebook, it felt as if we were heading into the complete unknown when we finally turned off Highway 395.<br><br>"Antelope," I said, looking down at the postcard to calm myself, reading the labels printed beneath the animals one by one. "Coyote. Tarantula."<br><br>We started down a ten-mile side road straight into a sandbox. In the middle of the box was a big dry lake, which looked like snow. My dad said cheerily, "Sure is nicer than the first time I came here," not noticing that even our black-and-white cockapoo puppy, Patches, wanted to hide, tucking her head under my leg and shaking.<br><br>After a pause, my dad retold a story we all had heard before. "I flew in on a tiny twin-engine plane from LA," he started. "It was really bumpy." We looked around for an airport, seeing only sand.<br><br>"Hey, I see it!" I pointed off to the left, where a single airstrip sat next to a white box of a building, not much bigger than my old bedroom.</p><h2>The Case for the Real Jesus - A Journalist Investigates Current Attacks on the Identity of Christ</h2><p>According to historic Christian teaching, he is the Christ: God incarnate, the awaited Messiah, crucified for sinners, resurrected from the dead, and raised to heaven, where he awaits his triumphant return.

Their fierce and unprecedented assault on the foundations of Christianity has confused spiritual seeks and created doubt among many Christians.</p><p></p><h2>The Course of True Love</h2><p>Used Book</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#39;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.March was doing exactly as it should; it had come in like a lamb, now it was going out like a lion. An icy rain driven by a roaring wind was sweeping the streets clear of all but those unfortunates who had been forced to go out. And these, needless to say, were scuttling along, anxious to get within doors as fast as possible.<p>There was a long queue half-way down the street, an impatient line of people under umbrellas, jostling for position, ready to rush forward when their bus arrived. The girl at the end of the queue edged away from the drips running down the back of her neck from the umbrella behind her and sighed resignedly. It had been a long day and she was tired and home was still a bus ride away; she could not even tell if she would be lucky enough to get on to the next bus...</p><p>It came, sending great splashes of water from the gutter as it slowed to a halt. The queue surged forward. The owner of the umbrella gave her a vicious poke in the back as the slow-moving elderly man in front of her stepped back and planted a foot on her instep. She gave a gasp of pain and came to an involuntary halt, to be instantly swept aside by those behind her. Which meant one foot, the injured one, in the muddy water of the gutter.</p><p>The bus went, taking with it almost all the queue, leaving the girl to lift a dripping foot back on to the pavement and hobble to join it once more. But she didn't reach it; the car which had drawn up behind the bus edged forward and stopped beside her and the driver got out.</p><p>He looked even taller than he actually was in the light of the street lamps and she couldn't see him very clearly. He said with decided impatience, 'Are you hurt? I saw what happened. Get into the car, I'll drive you home.'</p><p>She looked up from the contemplation of torn tights and a trickle of blood. 'Thank you; I prefer to go by bus.' Her voice was a pretty as her face but there was a decided chill to it.</p><p>'Don't be a fool, young woman, I've no intention of kidnapping you. Besides, you look hefty enough to take care of yourself.' He ignored her outraged gasp. 'Don't keep me waiting, I have an appointment.' The impatience was even more decided.</p><p>Still smarting from having her Junoesque and charming person referred to as hefty, the girl took his proffered arm and allowed herself to be settled beside him. 'Where to?' he asked, and slid into the stream of traffic.</p><p>The girl gave a delicate sniff; the car was a Rolls-Royce and smelled of leather and, faintly, of cologne. She said in her nice voice, still chilly though, 'You should have asked me before I got into the car, which I wouldn't have done if you hadn't been so impatient. Meadow Road, a turning off Stamford Street. That's.'</p><p>'I know where it is. Which number?'</p><p>'Fifteen.' She added, 'It's quite a long way. You could drop me off at a bus-stop; I shall be quite all right.'</p><p>He didn't answer, and after a moment she realised that he wasn't going to. She glanced at her foot; it had left a muddy, watery mark on the car's splendid carpet and it was bleeding sluggishly. Nothing serious, she decided.</p><p>They crossed the river and he turned the car into the busy streets around Waterloo station and then, without being told, into Meadow Road, a dingy street which didn't live up to its name for there wasn't a blade of grass throughout its length. Its houses were bay-windowed with steps leading to shabby front doors, and iron railings concealed the semi-basements. Her companion stopped before number fifteen and got out. It surprised her when he opened her door and offered a hand. She stood on the pavement, looking up at him; she was a tall girl but she had to look quite a way.</p><p>'Thank you, you were most kind. I hope you won't be late for your appointment.'</p><p>'What is your name?'</p><p>She answered matter-of-factly, 'Claribel Brown. What's yours?'</p><p>'Marc van Borsele. And now that we are introduced, I will come in with you and see to that foot.'</p><p>She saw then that he held a case in one hand. 'You're a doctor?'</p><p>'Yes.'</p><p>There seemed no point in arguing with him. 'Very well, though I'm perfectly able.'</p><p>'Let us waste no more time in polite chat.'</p><p>Claribel opened the gate to the basement with rather more force than necessary and led the way down the worn steps to her front door. In the sombre light of the street lamp its paint shone in a vibrant red and there were tubs on either side, holding the hopeful green shoots of daffodils. She got out her key and had it taken from her</p><p>and the door opened. He switched on the light, too, and then stood aside for her to enter.</p><p>There was a tiny lobby and an inner door leading to the living-room, small and perforce dark but very cosy. The furniture was mostly second-hand but had been chosen with care, and there was an out-of-date gas fire under the narrow mantelshelf. The one easy chair was occupied by two cats, one black and white, one ginger, curled up together. They unrolled themselves as Claribel went in, muttered softly at her, and curled up again.</p><p>'Do come in,' said Claribel unnecessarily, for he was already right behind her.</p><p>They stood for a moment and studied each other. Claribel was a pretty girl, almost beautiful with golden hair drawn back rather too severely into a knot, green eyes and a straight nose above a generous mouth. She was tall and magnificently built and looked a good deal younger than her twenty-eight years.</p><p>She stared back at her companion, frowning faintly because he was staring even harder. He was well over six feet, she supposed, and big with huge shoulders. He was also good-looking in a formidable way, with dark hair, sprinkled with grey, an aggressive nose, a firm thin mouth and dark eyes. He might be any age between thirty-five and forty, she guessed, and he had a nice taste in dress: conservative but elegant.</p><p>'Be good enough to take off your tights or whatever and let me see that foot.' He glanced at his watch. 'I can spare five minutes.'</p><p>The arrogance of the man! Someone should take him in hand, Claribel thought as he turned to undo his case. She whipped off her tights, sat down on a small upright chair and held her foot out.</p><p>There was more mud and blood; he poked and prodded, remarked that she would have a bruised foot but nothing worse and suggested that she should wash it. 'That's if you have a bathroom?'</p><p>She bit back what she would liked to have said in reply and went through the door at the back of the room and shut it behind her. The bathroom was a pokey little place reached through her bedroom; she cleaned her foot and whisked back to find him standing before the watercolour hanging over the mantelpiece.</p><p>'Your home?' he wanted to know.</p><p>'Yes.'</p><p>'The west country?'</p><p>'Yes.'

'A good thing we'll not meet again,' she observed to the cats curled up on the end of her bed, 'for he's too unsettling.'</p><p>It was still raining when she got up the next morning, dressed, breakfasted, fed the cats and tidied up her small flat.

How do we decide what to preserve and how to preserve? Who benefits from the efforts of preservationists, curators, developers, and other &#34;symbolic bankers&#34; to safeguard an increasing variety of structures for future generations? Diane Barthel raises these and other questions in this important new book. Taking a comparative approach, Barthel finds that preservation in Britain has largely been an elite enterprise aimed at preserving traditional values. In the United States, by contrast, the pattern is much more dynamic and democratic, though also more permeated by commercialism. Is preservation becoming another means of consuming history, like media representations or &#34;historic&#34; shopping outlets? Or does it have a special significance as a very tangible means of getting in touch with our collective and individual pasts? These and other issues--including war and remembrance, agrarian and industrial preservation, and religious preservation in a secular society--demonstrate the significance of what Barthel calls &#34;the Preservation Project&#34; and why we all have a stake in how our history is reconstructed and interpreted.</p><p></p><h2>Colour for Adventurous Gardeners</h2><p>This book on gardening with colour by its most adventurous exponent Christopher Lloyd OBE - is now available in paperback as well as hardback. With a chapter on every colour from &#39;Challenging Orange&#39; to &#39;Sophisticated Black&#39;, Lloyd explores each colour in relation to others and discusses the rules in order to encourage the gardener to break them. If a colour is &#39;polite&#39;, Lloyd certainly knows how to liven it up without making it vulgar. In an all-white border, he advocates a touch of clear pink to make you sit up; he suggests bright scarlet rose hips in a purple bed to introduce a note of rebellion. Stunning photographs by Jonathan Buckley enhance this superb collection of colour combinations.

A voracious private reader, she left her regular studies at fourteen to attend art school. In 1950 her first children's book was published, and from then on, she devoted her time and talents to writing children's historical novels. Many of her books are set in Roman Britain, a period that particularly interested her. She received the OBE in 1975 and, in 1992, was awarded the CBE. She was still writing on the morning of her death at the age of seventy-two.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Aquila halted on the edge of the hanging woods, looking down. Below him he could see the farmstead under the great, bare swell of the downs; the russet-roofed huddle of buildings, the orchard behind, making a darker pattern on the paleness of the open turf, the barley just beginning to show its first tinge of harvest gold, the stream that rose under the orchard wall and wandered down the valley to turn the creaking wheel of the water-mill that ground their corn.</p><p>Almost a year had gone by since the last time that he had stood here and looked down, for it was only last night that he had come home on leave from Rutupiae, where he commanded a troop of Rhenus Horse&#x2014;Auxiliary Cavalry; there had been no regular Legions in Britain for forty years now&#x2014;and every detail of the scene gave him a sharp-edged pleasure. It was good to be home. And really, the place didn&#x2019;t look so bad. It was not what it had been in the good old days, of course. Kuno, who was the oldest man on the farm, could remember when there had been vine terraces on the south slope; you could see the traces of them still, just below the woods here, like the traces of the old fields and the old sheep-runs that had had to be let go back to the wild. It was the Pict War that had done the mischief, so long ago that even Kuno couldn&#x2019;t remember, though he swore that he could, and, when he had drunk enough heather beer, used to tell everybody how he had seen the great Theodosius himself, when he came to drive out the Saxons and the Painted People. But though Theodosius had swept Britain clear, the damage had been done and the countryside had never been the same again. The great houses had been burned, the slaves had revolted against their masters, and the big estates had been ruined. It hadn&#x2019;t been so bad for the small estates and farms, especially those that were not worked with slave labour. Kuno was very fond of telling&#x2014;and the hearing of it always made Aquila feel humble, though he was sure that it should make him proud&#x2014;how in the bad time, the Killing Time, when the slaves revolted, the free men of his own farm had kept faith with his great-grandfather.</p><p>Because he was seeing his home again for the first time in almost a year, he was piercingly aware of it, and the things it stood for, and aware also how easily it might be lost. Old Tiberius&#x2019;s farm, not many miles further seaward, had been burned by the Saxon raiders last year. When you thought about it, you realized that you were living in a world that might fall to pieces at any moment; but Aquila seldom thought about it much. He had lived in that world all his life, and so had at least three generations of his kind before him, and it hadn&#x2019;t fallen to pieces yet, and it didn&#x2019;t seem likely that it would do so on this rich, ripening day with the powdery whiteness of July lying over the countryside.</p><p>There was the sound of flying feet behind him, and a brushing through the undergrowth and Flavia his sister was beside him, demanding breathlessly, &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you wait for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila turned his head to look at her. &#x201c;I got tired of propping up the wall of Sabra&#x2019;s cot, being stared out of countenance by that yellow-eyed cat of hers, while you chittered inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could have stayed inside and chittered too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to, thank you. Besides, I wanted to get back here and make sure the farm hadn&#x2019;t run away since breakfast.&#x201d; It was an odd thing to say, born of his sudden, unusual awareness, and they looked at each other quickly.</p><p>&#x201c;It is queer how one feels like that sometimes,&#x201d; the girl said, grave for the moment. And then the shadow passed, and she was sparkling again. &#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t run away&#x2014;and oh! it is so lovely that you are home again, Aquila! And look, here&#x2019;s honeysuckle with crimson tips; and here&#x2019;s clover, and blue scabious, as blue as a butterfly. I shall make a wreath for myself for dinner as though it were a banquet; just for myself, and not for you or Father at all, because men look silly in banquet wreaths, especially if they have galley-prow noses like yours!&#x201d; And while she spoke, she was down on her knees, searching among the leaves for the tough, slender scabious stems.</p><p>Aquila leaned against a tree and watched her, making a discovery. &#x201c;You have grown up while I have been away.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked up, the flowers in her hands. &#x201c;I was grown up before you went away. More than fifteen. And now I&#x2019;m more than sixteen&#x2014;quite old.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila wagged his head sadly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I say. I don&#x2019;t suppose you can even run now.&#x201d;</p><p>She sprang up, her face alight with laughter. &#x201c;What will you wager me that I do not reach the terrace steps ahead of you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A new pair of crimson slippers against a silver buckle for my sword-belt.&#x201d; Aquila pushed himself from the tree-trunk as she swooped up the skirt of her yellow tunic with the flowers in its lap.</p><p>&#x201c;Done! Are you ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Now!&#x201d;</p><p>They sprang away side by side over the short downland turf, by the level-and-drop of the old vine terraces, by the waste strip at the head of the cornland where the plough team turned, skirting the steading yard on flying feet. Flavia was half a spear&#x2019;s length ahead of him as they reached the steps of the terrace before the house and whirled about under the old spreading damson tree that grew there. &#x201c;Well? Can I still run? I can run faster than you can now, and I&#x2019;m a girl!&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila caught her by the wrist. &#x201c;You have sharp, hollow bones like a bird, and it is not fair.&#x201d; They flung themselves down on the step, panting and laughing, and he turned to look at her. He loved being with Flavia again, he always had loved being with her, even when they were small. She was two years younger than he was, but Demetrius, their Greek tutor, declared that they had been meant to be twins and something had gone wrong with their stars to bring about the two years one must wait for the other. Flavia&#x2019;s hair had come down and was flying about her shoulders; hair as black and harsh as a stallion&#x2019;s mane, and so full of life that she could comb sparks out of it when she combed it in the dark. He reached out and gave it a small, brotherly tug.</p><p>&#x201c;Brute!&#x201d; Flavia said happily. She drew up her knees and clasped her arms round them, tipping up her head to the sunshine that rimmed the damson leaves with gold and made the little dark damsons seem almost transparent. &#x201c;I do love being alive! I love the way things look and feel and smell! I love the dustiness of July, and the dry singing the wind makes through the grass, and the way the stones are warm to sit on, and the way the honeysuckle smells!&#x201d;</p><p>There was something almost fierce under her laughter; but that was always the way with Flavia: the fierceness and the laughter and the sparks flying out of her hair. She turned to him with a swift flash of movement. All her movements were swift and flashing. &#x201c;Show me the dolphin again.&#x201d;</p><p>With an air of long-suffering, Aquila pulled up the loose sleeve of his tunic and showed her, as he had showed her yesterday evening, the dolphin badge of their family rather inexpertly tattooed on the brown skin of his shoulder. One of the Decurions at Rutupiae had learned the trick from a Pictish hostage, and during the bad weather, when there was not much else to do, several of them had let him try his skill on them.</p><p>Flavia ran a fingertip over the blue lines. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure that I like it. You&#x2019;re not a Pict.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I had been, I&#x2019;d have had stripes and spirals all over me, not a nice neat little dolphin...It might come in very useful. If I were away from home for a long, long time, and when I came back nobody knew me again, like Odysseus, I could take you quietly aside and say, &#x2018;Look, I&#x2019;ve got a dolphin on my shoulder. I&#x2019;m your long-lost brother.&#x2019; And then you&#x2019;d know me again, like the old slave when she found the scar of the boar&#x2019;s tusk on Odysseus&#x2019;s thigh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Oh, stranger, anyone may get a dolphin tattooed on his shoulder.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d be more likely to recognize you by your nose, however long that had been away.&#x201d; She turned to the tangle of honeysuckle and small downland flowers in her lap, and began to arrange them for her garland. &#x201c;Are you as glad to be home as we are to have you, even though it is only one year and not twenty, like Odysseus?&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila nodded, glancing about him at the familiar scene. From close quarters one could see more clearly that the farm had known better days: the outbuildings that needed re-roofing, the wing of the house that had once been lived in and was now a grain-store, the general air of a place run without quite enough money, without quite enough men. But the pigeons were paddling in the sunlight below the terrace steps, and a flicker of brilliant blue showed where Gwyna was coming up with a milk-pail; and he was home again, sitting on the sun-warmed steps where they had sat as children, talking nonsense with Flavia.</p><p>Something moved in the farmyard, and Flavian their father came out from the stable, talking with Demetrius. Demetrius, who never smiled himself, said something at which their father laughed, flinging up his head like a boy; then he turned and came striding up toward the terrace, with Margarita his old wolfhound at his heels.</p><p>Aquila half-rose as he drew near. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sitting on the terrace steps; come and join us, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>And their father came and sat down on the top step, with Margarita between his knees.</p><p>&#x201c;Aquila owes me a pair of crimson slippers,&#x201d; Flavia said, reaching up to lay an arm across his knee. &#x201c;He said I was grown up and couldn&#x2019;t run anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Their father smiled. &#x201c;And you aren&#x2019;t, and you can. I heard the two of you skirling like curlews all the way down from the top woods. Mind you keep him up to paying his wager!&#x201d;</p><p>He was fondling Margarita&#x2019;s ears, drawing them again and again through his fingers, and the freckled sunlight under the leaves made small, shifting sparks of green fire in the flawed emerald of his great signet ring with its engraved dolphin.</p><p>Aquila twisted on his lower step to look up at him. It was hard to realize that Father was blind. There was nothing to show for it but the small scar that the Saxon arrow had made in his temple; and he came and went about the farm with that quick, sure stride, never seeming at a loss to know where he was or in what direction he wanted to go. Now he turned to his son and asked, &#x201c;How does the farm look to you, after a year away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The farm looks good to me,&#x201d; Aquila said, and added with perhaps a little too much vehemence, &#x201c;it looks so sure&#x2014;as though it had been here as long as the downs have been here, and must last as long as the downs remain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; their father said, suddenly grave. &#x201c;I wonder how long it will last&#x2014;just how long any of this life that we know will last.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila shifted abruptly. &#x201c;Oh, I know...But the worst never seems to happen.&#x201d; Yet the worst happened to Tiberius, last year, said something in his mind, and he hurried on, as much to silence it as anything else: &#x201c;When Vortigern called in that Saxon war band and settled them in the old Iceni territory to hold off the Picts, five&#x2014;no, six years ago, everyone wagged their heads and said it was the end of Britain. They said it was calling the wolf in over the threshold; but Hengest and his crew haven&#x2019;t done so badly. Settled quite peacefully, seemingly; and they have held off the Picts, and left us free to concentrate what Auxiliaries we still have along the Saxon shore to hold off their pirate brothers. Maybe Vortigern wasn&#x2019;t such a fool after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really think that?&#x201d; his father said very quietly, and his fingers checked on Margarita&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201c;It is what quite a lot of the others at Rutupiae think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The temper of the Eagles has changed since my day. Do you think it?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment&#x2019;s silence and then Aquila said, &#x201c;No, I suppose not, really. But it is more comfortable to think that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome has done too much of thinking what is comfortable,&#x201d; his father said.</p><p>But Aquila was not for the moment listening. He was looking away down the valley to where a small figure had just come into sight on the wagon-way that led up from the ford and the ancient track under the downs. &#x201c;Sa ha,&#x201d; he said softly, &#x201c;someone coming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; said his father.</p><p>&#x201c;No one I know. A little bent man&#x2014;looks as though he&#x2019;s carrying a basket on his back.&#x201d;</p><p>He thought that both his father and Flavia were suddenly alert in a way that he did not understand. He thought that there was a feeling of waiting about them. A few moments went by, and then his father asked, &#x201c;Can you see yet what it is that he carries?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. It is a basket. And something else&#x2014;a lantern on a pole. I believe he is one of those wandering bird-catchers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. Stand up and signal to him to come to me here.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila glanced at his father in puzzled surprise, then stood up and waved his arm above his head until the small, trudging figure saw the signal and flung up an arm in reply. &#x201c;He is coming,&#x201d; he said, and sat down again.</p><p>A short while later a small, earth-coloured man with a sharply pointed face like a water rat&#x2019;s came round the corner of the outbuildings and stood before the terrace steps, swinging the great reed basket from his shoulders almost before he had come to a halt. &#x201c;I greet my lord. My lord would like some fine fat quails, only caught this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take them up to the kitchen,&#x201d; Flavian said. &#x201c;It is a long time since you were here last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have had a long walk since I was here last,&#x201d; the man returned, and something in his rather hurried voice suggested the reply was a thing arranged beforehand. &#x201c;It is all of two hundred miles from Venta to the mountains.&#x201d;</p><p>As he spoke the words, he glanced aside out of doubtful dark eyes at Aquila, and Flavian, seeming to sense the swift, uneasy glance, said, &#x201c;Nay, there is nothing that need make you ill at ease, friend. My son is quite to be trusted.&#x201d; He took a slim wax tablet from the breast of his tunic. &#x201c;The quails up to the kitchen. My steward will pay you. And this to the usual place.&#x201d;</p><p>The man took the tablet without looking at it, and stowed it in the ragged breast of his own tunic. &#x201c;As my lord bids me,&#x201d; he said. He made a wide gesture of farewell that took in all three of them, and shouldering his basket again, turned and trudged off round the corner of the house toward the kitchen quarters.</p><p>Aquila watched him go, then turned back to his father. &#x201c;And what did that mean, sir?&#x201d; He thought Flavia knew.</p><p>Flavian gave a final pull to the old hound&#x2019;s ear, and released her with a pat. &#x201c;It means a message up to Dynas Ffaraon in the Arfon mountains.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Aquila said. &#x201c;What message is that?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a little silence, but he knew that his father was going to tell him.</p><p>&#x201c;I am going back into ancient history,&#x201d; Flavian said at last. &#x201c;Much of it you will know, but bear with me nonetheless, it is better to have the whole thing...</p><p>&#x201c;When Theodosius came to drive out the Picts that old Kuno so dearly loves to talk about, his lieutenant was one Magnus Maximus, a Spaniard. And when Theodosius went south again, he left Maximus in command behind him.

He is the best-selling author of Illiberal Education, The End of Racism, Ronald Reagan, and The Virtue of Prosperity. He divides his time between Washington, D.C, and San Diego, California.A young foot soldier of the "Reagan Revolution," bestselling author D'Souza (What's So Great About America, etc.) came to prominence during his years at Dartmouth, as one of the founders of the controversial Dartmouth Review. In his latest book, the newest installment in the Art of Mentoring series, D'Souza provides students of the next generation with a basic understanding of modern conservatism and its fundamental precepts. Addressing a fictional student by the name of "Chris," D'Souza outlines the major distinctions between the three main political positions in the U.S.: liberalism, conservatism and libertarianism. He goes on to explain how conservatism debunks an array of issues, such as affirmative action (it strengthens the "widespread suspicion that [blacks] might be intellectually inferior"), feminism ("the feminist error was to embrace the value of the workplace as greater than the value of the home"), postmodernism ("pompous, verbose, and incoherent") and some lesser known sins such as the "self-esteem hoax" (self-esteem doesn't promote better performance). In these chapters, the author is witty, even irreverent at times. He punctures the stereotype of conservatism as the dry and stodgy movement that liberals love to hate. Rather he says, conservatives are "radicals," resisting the morally deficient tide of modern liberalism, fighting for a common code of virtues. D'Souza will no doubt succeed in inspiring young conservatives to go out into the world and fight for what they believe in.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Virtue-Based Transformational Leadership</h2><p>The Art of Virtue-Based Transformational Leadership argues that the difficult changes faced by 21st century organizations, from corporations to families, require leadership based on values mutually held by visionaries and followers.

Now one of those secrets is about to come alive &#x2014; with a vengeance.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of nineteen Doc Ford novels, the Hannah Smith novel Gone, and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years.In Gone (2012), White introduced fishing guide Hannah Smith, hinting that she was interested in a relationship with marine biologist Doc Ford, the hero of White&#x2019;s acclaimed main series. Those hints almost come to fruition in the twentieth Ford novel, despite Ford&#x2019;s conviction that his other &#x201c;job,&#x201d; covert ops, won&#x2019;t mix with relationships. There are other roadblocks to romance, starting with a psycho convinced that Ford&#x2019;s opposition to &#x201c;jig-fishing&#x201d; for tarpon has cost him his shot at becoming a big-time documentarian. Then there&#x2019;s Ford&#x2019;s obsession with the disappearance of five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers in 1945, and finally, the presence on Ford&#x2019;s Sanibel Island home turf of a mysterious Brazilian who may also dabble in covert ops. Any of these plot strands might have made a novel in itself, and White has some trouble balancing them all. Still, for series fans, the overabundance of plot won&#x2019;t matter a whit. Call it a transitional episode with lots of distractions, if you must, but fans will still be riveted by Ford and Hannah&#x2019;s tango-like mating dance. And the climax is a corker, too. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Over his last several Doc Ford novels, White has vaulted to mainstream bestseller stauts. This one is likely to maintain the pattern. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Homer&#39;s The Iliad and The Odyssey: A Biography (Books That Changed the World)</h2><p>While it is unknown if there ever was a man named Homer, there is no doubt that the epic poems assembled under his name form the cornerstone of Western literature, feeding our imagination for over two and a half millennia. <i>The Iliad and The Odyssey</i>, with their tales of the Trojan War, Achilles, Ulysses and Penelope, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Helen of Troy, and the petulant gods, are familiar to most readers because they are so pervasive. From Plato to Virgil, Pope to Joyce, the poems have been told and retold, interpreted and embellished. In this graceful and sweeping book, Alberto Manguel traces the lineage of the poems from their inception and first recording. He considers the original purpose of the poems&#x2014;either as allegory of philosophical truth or as a record of historical truth&#x2014;surveys the challenges the pagan Homer presented to the early Christian world, and maps the spread of the works around the world and through the centuries. Manguel follows Homer through the greatest literature ever created and, above all, delights in the poems themselves.</p><p>Alberto Manguel is the bestselling author of several award-winning books, including A Dictionary of Imaginary Places and A History of Reading.Alberto Manguel's meticulous appreciation of Homer starts before the bard's epics were written and continues to the present. He discusses Homer's influence on a range of cultures and writers, down to the level of single metaphorical phrases. This sounds exhausting, but his love for his subject keeps it hypnotic, and Michael Prichard's delivery captures that emotional investment. Prichard evokes Homer's majesty as he reads the verse, and Manguel's admiration for the poet as well. A number of selections in the original Greek are included, as well as numerous translations and passages in other languages. Prichard declaims them all with a strong feel for cadence. He knows how to shift from a line describing intense violence to a scholarly gloss on the line without losing his listeners.

When she finally crosses a terrible boundary, her life comes rushing in at her in a way she never could have imagined. Unfolding over the next twenty-four hours, this searing, fast-paced novel explores the complex ties between mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, the meaning of devotion, and the line between love and hate. It is a challenging, moving, gripping story, written with the fluidity and strength of voice that only Alice Sebold can bring to the page.</p><p>Alice Sebold is the bestselling author of The Lovely Bones, a novel, and Lucky, a memoir. She lives in California with her husband, the novelist Glen David Gold.Listeners might be more easily absorbed into this brief lyrical novel were they not told in its opening sentences that the story�s narrator has just suffocated her rapidly deteriorating mother. From that point on, the story is told as a flashback involving an only child, a mentally ill mother, and a father who finally succeeds at suicide. Flashback requires reflection. Despite Joan Allen�s more than adequate rendering, audio by nature pushes ahead, not leaving a lot of space between the words. Repetition and slight variation, two of Sebold�s strong points on the page, become petty annoyances. New-age musical interludes between chapters are out of place with the tone of the novel. In this case, Sebold�s excellent writing has to be read on the page to be fully appreciated.

Art. In this first collection, Phoebe Gloeckner offers an array of both hyper-real and wildly surreal cartoons and drawings mirroring conjunctions between anatomical landscapes and far emotional journeys. &#34;Many cartoonists today mine their personal lives for subject matter. Phoebe Gloeckner achieves what few of them can; she makes the autobiographical universal. Her finely crafted drawings and emotionally powerful story-telling ability combine in this terrific collection to tell us painful, sympathetic and hilariously human truths. Read this book.

Ballard (RE/Search, 1990), <i>Weird Things You Can Grow</i> (Random House, 1994) and <i>Mind Riot</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997), a collection of comics for teens. In addition, she is a widely respected medical illustrator whose work has been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States.About suffering they were never wrong, The Old Masters," wrote Auden, lines that come to mind upon reading R. Crumb's introduction to Phoebe Gloeckner's largely autobiographical collection, A Child's Life; in it, he assesses her story <i>Minnie's Third Love</i> as "one of the comic-book masterpieces of all time." The old master is indeed right. Subtitled <i>Nightmare on Polk Street</i>, the tale Chronicles Gloeckner's teenage persona (usually called Minnie, but also Mary, Penny, and other variations) on the run from home, where she has been psychologically and sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. Combining observational precision with hallucinatory perspective, Gloeckner maps the emotional labyrinth of childhood trauma in such detail that she is somehow able to find her way out of it." -- <i>Eric Lorberer, <i>Rain Taxi</i>, Vol. 3, No. 3, Fall 1998</i><br><br>Gloeckner's unsparing memory and painstakingly detailed pen-and ink drawings of family dysfunction, childhood cruelty, and queasy sex make for seriously disquieting reading. The book takes us through the years with Gloeckner's alter ego Minnie, whose childhood is dominated by her overbearing, ogling stepfather and whose adolescence is spent on the streets of San Francisco in a morass of unsavory drugs and even less savory men. The unwelcome sexualization of young girls forms the center of every story in <i>A Child's Life</i>, not to mention the very introduction, in which cartoonist R. Crumb slobbers over the artist ("I'm just like all the other despicable males that appear in these comic stories...I, too, desired to subject the beautiful, intense young girl to all sorts of degrading and perverse sexual acts...") In Gloeckner's hands, the disturbing subject matter translates into absorbing art that's hard to wrap your eyes around, but unforgettable once you do. -- <i>Andi Zeisler and Lisa Miya-Jervis, <i>Bitch</i>, Vol. 3 No. 3, Winter 1998</i><br><br>Phoebe Gloeckner's <i>A Child's Life and Other Stories</i> is as perfect a publishing project as we're likely to see this calendar year: it collects short stories, both new and previously-published, from a period of over 20 years; the stories are consistently interesting and some are downright excellent; and the experience of reading all of the work in one place creates an artistic whole greater than the sum of its parts. -- <i>Tom Spurgeon, <i>The Comics Journal</i>, No. 207, September 1998</i></p><h2>What Great Paintings Say: Vol. 1</h2><p>Why should a banker, two actresses and a seamstress meet at a riverside restaurant?

But to help her friend, and to find the real killer of a man she once adored and is now not sure she ever knew, Rebecka must relive the darkness she left behind in Kiruna, delve into a sordid conspiracy of deceit, and confront a killer whose motives are dark, wrenching, and impossible to guess....</p><p>Asa Larsson was born in Kiruna, Sweden, in 1966.

Like a lonely whale beneath the sea?<br><br> And as if his thoughts have touched her, she stops for a second. Breaks her endless journey. Contemplates Viktor Strandg�rd with her cold winter eyes. Because he is as beautiful as an icon lying there, to tell the truth, with the dark blood like a halo round his long, fair, St. Lucia hair. He can&#x2019;t feel his legs anymore. He is getting drowsy. There is no pain.<br><br> Curiously enough it is his previous death he is thinking of as he lies there looking into the eye of the dragon. That time in the late winter when he came cycling down the long bank toward the crossroads at Adolf Hedinsv�gen and Hjalmar Lundbohmsv�gen. Happy and redeemed, his guitar on his back. He remembers how the wheels of his bicycle skidded helplessly on the ice as he tried desperately to brake. How he saw the woman in the red Fiat Uno coming from the right. How they stared at each other, the realization in the other&#x2019;s eyes; now it&#x2019;s happening, the icy slide toward death.<br><br> With that picture in his mind&#x2019;s eye Viktor Strandg�rd dies for the second time in his life. Footsteps approach, but he doesn&#x2019;t hear them. His eyes do not have to see the gleam of the knife once again. His body lies like an empty shell on the floor of the church; it is stabbed over and over again. And the dragon resumes her journey across the heavens, unmoved.<br><br> Monday, February 17<br><br> Rebecka Martinsson was woken by her own sharp intake of breath as fear stabbed through her body. She opened her eyes to darkness. Just between the dream and the waking, she had the strong feeling that there was someone in the flat. She lay still and listened, but all she could hear was the sound of her own heart thumping in her chest like a frightened hare. Her fingers fumbled for the alarm clock on the bedside table and found the little button to light up the face. Quarter to four. She had gone to bed four hours ago and this was the second time she had woken up.<br><br> It&#x2019;s the job, she thought. I work too hard. That&#x2019;s why my thoughts go round and round at night, like a hamster on a squeaking wheel.<br><br> Her head and the back of her neck were aching. She must have been grinding her teeth in her sleep. Might as well get up. She wound the duvet around her and went into the kitchen. Her feet knew the way without her needing to switch on the light. She put on the coffee machine and the radio. Bellman&#x2019;s music played over and over as the water ran through the filter and Rebecka showered.<br><br> Her long hair could dry in its own time. She drank her coffee while she was getting dressed. Over the weekend she had ironed her clothes for the week and hung them up in the wardrobe. Now it was Monday. On Monday&#x2019;s hanger was an ivory blouse and a navy blue Marella suit. She sniffed at the tights she&#x2019;d been wearing the previous day; they&#x2019;d do. They&#x2019;d gone a bit wrinkly around the ankles, but if she stretched them and tucked them under her feet it wouldn&#x2019;t show. She&#x2019;d just have to make sure she didn&#x2019;t kick her shoes off during the day. It didn&#x2019;t bother her; it was only worth spending time worrying about your underwear and your tights if you thought somebody was going to be watching you get undressed. Her underwear had seen better days and was turning gray.<br><br> An hour later she was sitting at her computer in the office. The words flowed through her mind like a clear mountain stream, down her arms and out through her fingers, flying over the keyboard. Work soothed her mind. It was as if the morning&#x2019;s unpleasantness had been blown away.<br><br> It&#x2019;s strange, she thought. I moan and complain like all the other young lawyers about how unhappy the job makes me. But I feel a sense of peace when I&#x2019;m working. Happiness, almost. It&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;m not working I feel uneasy.<br><br> The light from the street below forced its way with difficulty through the tall barred windows. You could still make out the sound of individual cars among the noise below, but soon the street would become a single dull roar of traffic. Rebecka leaned back in her chair and clicked on &#x201c;print.&#x201d; Out in the dark corridor the printer woke up and got on with the first task of the day. Then the door into reception banged. She sighed and looked at the clock. Ten to six. That was the end of her peace and quiet.<br><br> She couldn&#x2019;t hear who had come in. The thick carpets in the corridor deadened the sound of footsteps, but after a while the door of her room opened.<br> &#x201c;Am I disturbing you?&#x201d; It was Maria Taube. She pushed the door open with her hip, balancing a mug of coffee in each hand. Rebecka&#x2019;s copy was jammed under her right arm.<br><br> Both women were newly qualified lawyers with special responsibility for tax laws, working for Meijer &amp; Ditzinger. The office was at the very top of a beautiful turn-of-the-century building on Birger Jarlsgatan. Semi-antique Persian carpets ran the length of the corridors, and here and there stood imposing sofas and armchairs in attractively worn leather. Everything exuded an air of experience, influence, money and competence. It was an office that filled clients with an appropriate mixture of security and reverence.<br><br> &#x201c;By the time you die you must be so tired you hope there won&#x2019;t be any sort of afterlife,&#x201d; said Maria, and put a mug of coffee on Rebecka&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;But of course that won&#x2019;t apply to you, Maggie Thatcher. What time did you get here this morning? Or haven&#x2019;t you been home at all?&#x201d;<br><br> They&#x2019;d both worked in the office on Sunday evening. Maria had gone home first.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only just got here,&#x201d; lied Rebecka, and took her copy out of Maria&#x2019;s hand.<br><br> Maria sank down into the armchair provided for visitors, kicked off her ridiculously expensive leather shoes and drew her legs up under her body.<br><br> &#x201c;Terrible weather,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Rebecka looked out the window with surprise. Icy rain was hammering against the glass. She hadn&#x2019;t noticed earlier. She couldn&#x2019;t remember if it had been raining when she came into work. In fact, she couldn&#x2019;t actually remember whether she&#x2019;d walked or taken the Underground. She gazed in a trance at the rain pouring down the glass as it beat an icy tattoo.<br><br> Winter in Stockholm, she thought. It&#x2019;s hardly surprising that you shut down your brain when you&#x2019;re outside. It&#x2019;s different up at home, the blue shining midwinter twilight, the snow crunching under your feet. Or the early spring, when you&#x2019;ve skied along the river from Grandmother&#x2019;s house in Kurravaara to the cabin in Jiekaj�rvi, and you sit down and rest on the first patch of clear ground where the snow has melted under a pine tree. The tree bark glows like red copper in the sun. The snow sighs with exhaustion, collapsing in the warmth. Coffee, an orange, sandwiches in your rucksack.<br><br> The sound of Maria&#x2019;s voice drew her back. Her thoughts scrabbled and tried to escape, but she pulled herself together and met her colleague&#x2019;s raised eyebrows.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello! I asked if you were going to listen to the news.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d;<br><br> Rebecka leaned back in her chair and stretched out her arm to the radio on the windowsill.<br><br> Lord, she&#x2019;s thin, thought Maria, looking at her colleague&#x2019;s rib cage as it protruded from under her jacket. You could play a tune on those ribs.<br><br> Rebecka turned the radio up and both women sat with their coffee cups cradled between their hands, heads bowed as if in prayer.<br><br> Maria blinked. It felt as if something were scratching her tired eyes. Today she had to finish the appeal for the county court in the Stenman case. M�ns would kill her if she asked him for more time. She felt a burning pain in her midriff. No more coffee before lunch. You sat here like a princess in a tower, day and night, evenings and weekends, in this oh-so-charming office with all its bloody traditions which could go to hell, and all the pissed-up partners looking straight through your blouse while outside, life just carried on without you. You didn&#x2019;t know whether you wanted to cry or start a revolution but all you could actually manage was to drag yourself home to the TV and pass out in front of its soothing, flickering screen.<br><br> <i>It&#x2019;s six o&#x2019;clock and here are the morning headlines.

They show how President Franklin D. Roosevelt, disenchanted with the failed League of Nations and determined to break the cycle of ever more destructive wars, worked with American and foreign leaders and became the driving force behind the creation of the U. N.</p><p>At a time when it is fashionable to declare the United Nations as part of the problem, rather than the solution, to international conflicts, two noted historians lucidly explain how the original objective of the body has been lost among indecision, ideological quarreling, and a lack of clear leadership. In <i>FDR and the Creation of the U.N.,</i> Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley examine the inception of the U.N. and chart its rocky history, identifying FDR as the primary player in the creation of the assembly. <p> In citing the U.N.'s biggest problems, the authors do not call for disbanding the body. Instead, in keeping with FDR's original vision, they offer solutions for improvements and insights. The challenges are formidable, however, as even daily operations are stalled due to the debt of $3.3 billion owed by U.N. members. The authors pay particular attention to the United States' responsibility for international peacekeeping. To make the U.N. effective, they argue, the U.S. must not only pay its share of the debt, but accept the fact that it has the military and political power to create results--if only it chooses to do so.</p>In recent years the United Nations has become more active in - and more generally respected for - its peacekeeping efforts than at any other period in its fifty-year history. During the same period, the United States has been engaged in a debate about the place of the U.N. in the conduct of its foreign policy. This book, the first account of the American role in creating the United Nations, tells an engrossing story and also provides a useful historical perspective on the controversy. Prizewinning historians Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley explain how the idea of the United Nations was conceived, debated, and revised, first within the U.S. government and then by negotiation with its major allies in World War II. The experience of the war generated increasing support for the new organization throughout American society, and the U.N. Charter was finally endorsed by the community of nations in 1945. The story largely belongs to President Franklin Roosevelt, who was determined to form an organization that would break the vicious cycle of ever more destructive wars (in contrast to the failed League of Nations), and who therefore assigned collective responsibility for keeping the peace to the five leading U.N. powers - the major wartime Allies. Hoopes and Brinkley focus on Roosevelt but also present vivid portraits of others who played significant roles in bringing the U.N. into being: these include Cordell Hull, Sumner Welles, Dean Acheson, Harry Hopkins, Wendell Willkie, Thomas Dewey, Arthur Vandenberg, William Fulbright, Edward Stettinius, and Walter Lippmann. In an epilogue, the authors discuss the checkered history of the United Nations and consider its future prospects.</p><h2>Basics and Applications (Creative Large Format Photography)</h2><p>Used.

This is the first hardcover edition.</p><p>John D. MacDonald (1916-1986) MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pa, and educated at the Universities of Pennsylvania, Syracuse and Harvard, where he took an MBA in 1939. After war service in the Far East he wrote hundreds of stories for the pulps and over seventy novels, including the 21 in the Travis McGee sequence.<br><br>Award-winning narrator RICHARD FERRONE is a lawyer-turned-actor who spent eight years with the Tony Award-winning Trinity Repertory and then Tony Randall's National Actors Theatre. He has appeared on several popular TV series including <i>Law &amp; Order</i> and <i>Against the Law</i>.One<br><br>The gentle hand of a girl pressed him awake, and he looked up along a tailored arm at the gloriously empty smile of a stewardess. &#x201c;Fasten your seat belt, please.&#x201d;<br><br>When he straightened in the seat and began to grope for the ends of the belt, she resumed her tour of inspection, looking from side to side, waking other sleepers.<br><br>It would have to be a surgical technique, he decided. Their smiles are all too alike. A few minutes of deftness with the scalpel, cutting the frown muscles loose, rehooking the nerve circuits, and you would limit each of them to just two expressions--the habitual superior blandness or the dazzling smile. Perhaps with true corporate efficiency they had hooked the smile to the vocal nerve complex so that they could not speak without smiling. &#x201c;Prepare for ditching,&#x201d; would be said with the same smile as, &#x201c;How would you like your fillet, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>But of course they had not yet been able to do anything about the expression of the eyes. They all looked at you with the same aseptic, merciless disdain, then walked away, germless Dynel hair a-bounce under the trig cap, tennis hips swinging the military worsted skirts, any bounce of breasts falling neatly within the maximum and minimum allowable limits as set by the airline.<br><br>He ran the pad of his thumb down the line of his jaw, feeling the sandstone texture of the night growth of beard, and smacked his lips in self-disgust at the stale and clotted taste in his mouth. He was on the starboard side of the airplane, behind the wings, and as it tilted into the landing pattern, he looked out the port windows and saw the dawn jumble of the city, with random neon still on, paling in the grayness, and the shining eyes of some small cars in the small streets.<br><br>The airplane slowed as the flaps were extended, and it felt tentative and less airworthy under him, so that he inadvertently tightened his buttock muscles and held his chest a little higher.<br><br>There had been so much jet travel in this past year, a Super-Constellation felt like a flapping silly thing, rough and haphazard, like an old lady roller skating on cobblestones. An intrusion of history, he thought, to ride in this sister of the Ford Tri-motor, and to be killed in one would have certain ludicrous overtones.<br><br>&#x201c;Snob,&#x201d; he said to himself. Fanciful snob at that, with the analysis of surgical smiles, and preference for dying up-to-date--but always fanciful when overtired, always that half step to one side of reality, so the world bulges into strange shapes.<br><br>He saw, to the east, a dark gray velvet sea with a pink rim, delicate as porcelain, and then looked down at the racing, upcoming ribbon of warehouses, scrubby lots, auto dumps; then saw the landing strip lights, and tucked his anus up yet more firmly until he felt the yelp of tires, the second contact, the rolling that began to slow down. Then the muscles softened, and he unlatched the safety belt and stifled the sigh that meant--&#x201c;Hubbard, you made it again.&#x201d; Hubbard, the hero of progress. He remembered being told that when his grandfather bought a battery flashlight and brought it home, they made him go out into the yard to light it up. Dangers have become more joyless. Each horseless carriage shall be proceeded by a man on horseback carrying a red flag by day and a lighted lantern by night.<br><br>He retrieved his hat and dispatch case from the overhead shelf and walked down the stairway on wheels into a curious damp warmth like that of a team locker-room a little while after the last hot shower has been taken. There were puddles on the ramp from recent rain. He marched with the others down an endless corridor, thinking that the air age is turning us into a race of pedestrians.<br><br>The main part of the terminal was so savagely air-conditioned he felt chilled when the sweat of walking began an immediate evaporation. He found a men&#x2019;s room, whitely lighted, and as he was washing his hands he stared dispassionately at himself in the mirror and was mildly astonished he should look so tidy in that cruel light. The smut-shadow of beard gave him somewhat the look of imported syndicate muscle, but, he decided, of the upper echelon where the payoff goes into a numbered account and the shotgun stock is of Circassian walnut.<br><br>But muscle, nevertheless, he thought sadly. The analogy works. Hubbard shoots the stock option out from under one Jesse Mulaney. He shoots Mulaney&#x2019;s name off the office door. This time it will be worse than usual because I do like that fat, fumbling, nervy, scared son-of-a-bitch--for reasons which escape me.<br><br>He collected his suitcase from the baggage pen and headed for a distant door which seemed as if it might lead to taxicabs. He hefted the suitcase and wondered if Jan had repacked it with the kind of clothing he would need. Though she had yet to fail him, he always felt unprepared when he did not have the time and opportunity to do his own packing. This time there had been even less notice than usual, and Jan had hustled the suitcase to the airport at almost the last moment, with even her good disposition showing signs of erosion.<br><br>He pulled the cab door shut and said, &#x201c;The Sultana, please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sultana coming up,&#x201d; the driver said and wrenched the cab away from the curb. They sped through the empty six o&#x2019;clock streets on octagonal wheels with a continuous bounce, bang and rumble of springs and shocks. The interior stank of a harsh antiseptic vividly flavored with mint, a device which failed to accomplish its purpose, to conceal the illness of a passenger carried not very long ago. Hubbard rolled the nearest window down the rest of the way and lit a cigarette. The damp warm air blew in on him, coming from some endless cellar full of ripe mushrooms and old swimming trunks. On the causeway the air had a fresher, saltier scent. The street lights went out. An old man in what looked like bright yellow pajamas fled across the road in front of the cab and turned to shriek an obscenity. An ambulance sped past them with descending doppler scream, a prowl car close behind it. Above the entrance to a strip joint was a forty-foot-high plywood silhouette of someone named Saturday Jones. The beach street wore a compacted, sodden litter that looked as if parades had gone by, honoring the more ancient perversions.<br><br>The cab headed north past increasingly arrogant and fanciful hotel structures. A massive woman in white slacks and white halter strolled the lonely sidewalk with a small trotting dog on a leash. Hubbard had to look back to assure himself that the dog was not pale purple, but it was. The static fronds of all the palm trees were obviously the product of patience, metal shears and an endless supply of green enameled tin. The bursting beds of flowers were vulgarities perpetrated by thousands of busy-fingered, stone-faced little Polish women.<br><br>The driver yanked the cab through a mausoleum gate and up a glossy acreage of asphalt. Before the cab plunged under the daring tilt of the cantilevered roof that sheltered the main entrance, Hubbard caught a glimpse of a huge black, white and red banner which said, &#x201c;Welcome APETOD!!!&#x201d;<br><br>The cab stopped with a dual complaint of tires and brakes, and the driver said with dreary pride, &#x201c;Sultana, nineteenahalf minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>A big doorman with a meaty, military face came gravely to take the two pieces of luggage. Hubbard paid the driver. Three stout disheveled men were standing in a patch of ornamental shrubbery. They wore tropical suits, ragged straw peon hats and big round convention buttons.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddam it, Hank,&#x201d; one of them was saying loudly. &#x201c;Every goddam time we all agree I&#x2019;m going to take the tenor, you come in and take it too. Now goddam it dyah wanna sing it right or dyah wanna sing it wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>The plate-glass door swung shut, and Hubbard walked on thick carpeting in a chill that felt five degrees lower than the terminal building had been. As he walked toward the distant registration desk, he puzzled over APETOD. Association for the Prevention of? Of what? Everything Tough Or Dirty. Sign me up, brothers. I will join.<br><br>In remote corners and alcoves and setbacks of the lobby area, work gangs were sweeping, polishing, cleaning, rearranging. He looked at the complex vistas of ramps and glass, pastels and plastics, at all the contrived decadence of crypto-modern, and remembered that a friend of his had once described the decor of a neighboring hotel as being Early Dental Plate. The huge hotel, now being brushed and polished by the maintenance crews, was like some bawdy, obese, degenerate old queen who, having endured prolonged orgy, was now being temporarily restored to a suitably regal condition by all the knaves and wenches who serve her.<br><br>The desk clerk had a varnished wave in his baby-pale hair, and adorably narrow little lapels, and a bruised and winsome little mouth to smile with, and the eyes of one of the larger lizards, unwinking, unforgiving.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hubbard?&#x201d; he said. He caressed his Cardex. &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have nothing reserved, no.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Try American General Machine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x201d; the clerk cooed. &#x201c;Yes indeed. Coming in today, with the convention. Lovely accommodations, sir. Eighth floor, north wing, with an ocean suite and other rooms. I have it all reserved under a Mr. Mulaney. Would that be correct? A party of ten?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be correct.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would Mr. Mulaney be making the room assignments for the group?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be happy to have me pick my own. What&#x2019;s reserved?&#x201d;<br><br>The clerk drifted away and came back with a room chart sealed in plastic. &#x201c;This is a standard floor plan, sir, for all our north wing floors, with the numbers the same except, of course, the floor designation digit missing. Let me see now. You have the master suite at the end, a three-bedroom suite and this smaller adjacent suite and this pair of interconnecting singles and the three singles along this side. Um, yes. That would be ten, wouldn&#x2019;t it? Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any of these three singles will be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, sir, as long as you are the first one here, you could be on the ocean side. These are really the less desirable . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d like,&#x201d; Hubbard said, and hoped the clerk wouldn&#x2019;t break into tears. &#x201c;Can you give me one now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh gracious, that might be a problem. APETOD had their farewell banquet last night. We might have to move you later in the day, give you some other . . . Let me check with the housekeeper on eight north, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>The clerk murmured into a phone, hung up and smiled in a sweet and happy way. &#x201c;Eight forty-seven is available, sir. We won&#x2019;t have to move you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, fine,&#x201d; Hubbard said, and hoped the lad wouldn&#x2019;t collapse with joy.<br><br>A soft chime summoned a bellhop who led Hubbard to the proper bank of elevators. They walked a long way down the total silence of the eighth floor. A housekeeping cart stood outside the open door of 847. A brawny monochromatic woman in white was stripping the twin beds. She looked at them with total hostility.<br><br>&#x201c;This was supposed to be ready,&#x201d; the bellhop said.<br><br>&#x201c;So who says suppose? So who knows about ready? Do forty-seven she says, so I do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do it,&#x201d; the bellhop said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Hubbard said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d; He tipped the boy. The room smelled of stale cigar and a faint pungency of perfume. He took off his hat and jacket and loosened his tie. Sliding a glass door aside, he stepped out onto a tiny triangular terrace, just big enough for the chaise fashioned of aluminum and plastic webbing and one small metal table. The vertical sawtooth construction of the side of the building gave the terraces the illusion of privacy. A tall glass containing a collapsed straw, an inch of pale orange liquid, and a poisonous-looking cherry stood on the railing. He leaned on the railing and looked down at orderly arrangements of acres of sun cots, at two pools, one Olympic and the other larger and freeform, at a thatched bar and a pagoda bar, at the empty alignment of outdoor tables and chairs, and the lush calligraphy of the planting areas. The sun was behind him, shining on tall pale distant buildings, leaving the area below him in blue-gray shadow.<br><br>The woman came out and snatched the glass, looked around for other debris, snorted and went back into the room. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s done!&#x201d; she bellowed a few minutes later. As he turned, the corridor door slammed shut.<br><br>He unpacked. Jan had done well. But there was no fond funny note, no silly present for him. Of course, he told himself, she had no time for such nonsense. Not this time. The room had the sterility of a place where no one had ever lived. The little stains and abrasions and scars had been cleverly added to make him believe he was not the last living man in the world. The machines did not want him to be too lonely, so they added these subliminal clues.<br><br>He ordered up juice, eggs, cocoa and a morning paper. After he finished, he pushed the cart out into the hall, closed the terrace door, pulled the draperies shut. He turned a bedlight on, showered, put on his pajamas, got into bed. By then it was late enough to place the call to Jan.<br><br>&#x201c;Was it a good trip, dear?&#x201d; she asked. Her voice was dimmed by the humming distance, flat and uninvolved.<br><br>&#x201c;They tried to cut us off at the waterhole, but we fought our way out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? I couldn&#x2019;t hear you, dear. Mike was bellering.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was okay. I got some sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. Mike wants to talk to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Daddy! Daddy! You know what, Daddy! I&#x2019;m limping!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now how about that!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When you come home I&#x2019;ll be limping! Are you coming home now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty soon, boy.&#x201d; When Jan came back on the line he said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the limp?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very convincing, when he doesn&#x2019;t forget which leg it is. He turned his ankle and demanded a bandage. How&#x2019;s the weather there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tropical. By the way, I&#x2019;m in eight forty-seven.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have a truly hilarious convention, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks so much. This won&#x2019;t be a picnic. You know what I have to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Her voice was inaudible for a moment. &#x201c;. . . not many picnics for anybody any more. I miss them. Thanks for calling. Keep in touch, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will. I will indeed. Love you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Also, of course. Rest up, if they give you the chance. &#x2019;Bye.&#x201d;<br><br>After he hung up he had a premonition of what could happen. The district man, whichever one had been stuck with the mechanics of the arrangements for the AGM group, would be over to check everything out. And he would find Hubbard was already registered and in, and he would feel terribly anxious to make certain that Mr. Hubbard was ecstatically content with everything.</p><h2>Phoenix and the Carpet (Wordsworth Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The Phoenix and the Carpet is E.

This is especially true for people who worry about the side effects of Prozac and other similar drugs. Now Dr. Susan Vaughan offers compelling evidence, based on new scientific research, that the process of talking with a trained therapist actually alters the way the brain's neurons are connected and effects permanent, positive changes in how we interact with the world. <br><br>Dr. Vaughan interweaves stories from therapy sessions with cutting-edge research results. She shows how interpreting dreams, free-associating, and attention to childhood experiences have an impact on the structure of our brain. Anyone who, for one reason or another, questions the value of long-term drug therapy will welcome the alternative approach presented here.<br></p><p>The fact that Woody Allen has spent a lifetime in psychotherapy has convinced many people who need help that talking it out with a therapist is pointless when drugs can do the same job, only quicker. But <i>The Talking Cure</i> makes a strong argument in favor of psychoanalytically based psychotherapy. Susan Vaughan, a veteran researcher, asserts that talking itself can change neural pathways in the brain (she says that instead of <i>Listening to Prozac</i> we should be <i>Talking to Neurons</i>), leading to permanent, positive change, sometimes in conjunction with drugs, sometimes without.Susan C.

The demands placed on it in the first decade of the twentieth century are nothing compared to today's demands. Then it was essentially a workroom, a utilitarian space, yet far more complicated than the rest of the house. </p> <p>During the Arts &amp; Crafts movement, it was believed that family life would center in the living room around the hearth. Today, the kitchen has supplanted the living room as the central place in our homes. Not only must it be functional, it is seen as a gathering place for family and guests, a status symbol, a place for projects, and a vehicle for self-expression. </p> <p>There are many reasons to have a bungalow kitchen-to either restore the one that is there or to build a new one in a period way. Bungalow kitchens are an important piece of history-the history of the house, of the twentieth century, of women, and of technology. And because of their simplicity, usefulness, honesty of design and materials, they can easily be made to function for the twenty-first century without compromising their integrity. </p> <p>Jane Powell is a restoration consultant, house restorer, lecturer, and author of six books, including Bungalow Kitchens, Bungalow Bathrooms, Bungalow Details: Exterior, Bungalow Details: Interior, Bungalow: The Ultimate Arts and Crafts Home, and Linoleum. </p> <p>As a hands-on restorer, she has brought ten vintage homes back to life and sold them to appreciative buyers, and continues the ongoing restoration of her own home, the 1905 Jesse Matteson house.

Bess Curran, 40, is a successful interior decorator in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area--in spite of her bitterness that ex- husband Michael, in their married days, had offered no support at all for her career. Michael is sour, too, but he's most hurt by the absolute hatred of their son Randy, who at 19 has left school, lives with Mom, plays drums, and smokes pot. It's daughter Lisa, though, who brings Bess and Michael together at a dinner when she announces that she and Mark Padgett--a clean-cut young man, so athletic his muscular forearms ``appeared unable to comfortably touch his sides''--will marry soon and are expecting. Bess and Michael approve of the new in-laws--friendly and wholesome (Mr. Padgett toasts with iced tea)--and Randy is attracted to Mark's sister, Maryanne, who asks Pa before accepting a ride home and won't stand for cussin'. Meanwhile, proximity works its magic: Michael asks Bess to decorate his condo, and grandmother Stella (a dismally sexy old babe) reminds Bess of her part in the breakup. It all ends with two hospital whammos: Lisa's birthing and Randy's maiden trip on cocaine. But, of course, there's a happy close. Apart from some frantic sex, it's as sunny and bland as milk pudding--though with a selling uplift message. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Kod�jin, the "Old Taoist" (1865-1944), was the last of these great poet-painters in Japan. Portraying this last representative of a tradition of gentle and refined artistry in the midst of a society that valued economic growth and national achievement, this beautifully illustrated book includes a wide selection of his finest poems, paintings, and calligraphy.</p></p><p>Rooting around in a Kyoto antique shop, Stephen Addiss came across a fine example of literati painting by a hand he didn't recognize. Little did he know then that he had discovered an artist he now calls the last of Japan's great literati, Fukuda Kodojin. Kodojin, who styled himself "Old Taoist," should have gone the way of other effete scholars with Japan's radical 19th-century modernization. Instead he wandered in the boundless realms of the three treasures--painting, poetry, and calligraphy--until his death in 1944. Addiss discovered the genuine article, a scholar of cultured sensibility who had mastered the ancient Chinese arts and expressed them with a style all his own. Addiss introduces us to that style through dozens of examples of Kodojin's painting and calligraphy, and over 250 poems. To translate the Chinese poetry, he recruited Jonathan Chaves, who shows the scholar's work to be elegant and wistful, echoing themes of Confucianism and Taoism. Kodojin's work transports us back to a time when art was a way of communicating among friends and not cheapened by exchanges of money. <i>Old Taoist</i> reminds us that even in a modern world, the pursuit of beauty and genuineness are not only possible but necessary. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p>Stephen Addiss is Tucker-Boatwright Professor in the Humanities in the Department of Art at the University of Richmond.

Fearful that the Columbia River would be lost to them, the Governor and COuncil of the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company decided to establish a base north of the 48th parallel.

Those who read their stories will be enriched by the spirit of the residents of Marshall Street.</p><p>ELAINE KRASNOW ELLISON was born on Marshall Street and lived there until she married. She is a speech-language pathologist. ELAINE MARK JAFFE was born around the corner from Marshall Street, where she lived until she married. She is a teacher in the Philadelphia school system.For the first half of this century, Marshall Street was Philadelphia's version of Manhattan's Lower East Side: a bustling enclave of immigrant Jews who lived above the stores where they sold everything from pickled cow's tongue to hand-cut windowshades. The writers, who grew up in the neighborhood, have assembled a collection of oral histories that allow the reader to experience Marshall Street--its noise, crowds, pushcarts, merchants, stores and ``sheels.'' The residents worked around the clock--``There was no such thing as `closed,' '' recalls Chaika, one of the dozens of former Marshall Street residents whose memories bring the neighborhood to life. Work was the key to success--that and education for the children. ``I finished high school,'' recalls Dottie, who ran a restaurant with her husband, but her children ``had to do better.'' They did and, in fulfilling their parents' dreams, they moved right up and out of the neighborhood. A couple of family businesses remain, but according to the authors, Marshall Street is ``a shadow of its former self.'' That makes this book all the more worthwhile. The memories are treasures, the stories universal and Voices makes intriguing reading for anyone interested in turn-of-the-century immigrant life in America's cities. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Church Summer Cramp (Tales from the Back Pew)</h2><p><p><strong>From the author and artist of the Tales from the Back Pew series comes a perfect story for every child who has gone to church summer camp and really didn&#x2019;t want to!</strong></p><p>In <em>Church Summer Cramp</em>, Mom&#x2019;s sending our hero to church summer cramp&#x2014;I mean, camp.

Peirce, the allusive nineteenth-century philosopher-scientist and founder of pragmatism, a man always on the periphery of the academic and social establishment yet intimately conjoined with them by birth and upbringing. Through Peirce and his wife Juliette, a lady of shadowy antecedents, Howe creates an intriguing nexus that explores the darker, melancholy sides of the <em>fin-de-siecle</em> Anglo-American intelligentsia. George Meredith and his wife Mary Ellen, Swinburne and his companion Theodore Watts-Dunton, are among those who also find a place in the three long poem-sequences that comprise the book. Howe&#x2019;s historical linkings, resonant with the sorrows of love and loss and the tragedies of war, create a compelling canvas of associations. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the blanks and gaps,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;that to me actually represent what poetry is&#x2015;the connections between seemingly unconnected things&#x2015;as if there is a place and might be a map to thought, when we know there is not.&#x201d;</p><p>Susan Howe has won the Bollingen Prize, the Frost Medal, and the Griffin Award. She is the author of such seminal works as <em>Debths</em>, <em>That</em><em>This</em>, <em>The</em><em>Midnight</em>, <em>My</em><em>Emily</em><em>Dickinson</em>, <em>The</em><em>Quarry</em>, and <em>The</em><em>Birthmark</em>.With her first book of new poems in six years, Howe further solidifies her reputation as one of North Americas foremost experimental writers. Pierce-Arrow engages many of the elements and themes that have consistently appeared in both her poetry (The Europe of Trusts, etc.) and prose (My Emily Dickinson and The Birth Mark). Here, as in previous work, the manuscripts and marginalia of marginal and anti-institutional authors (with an emphasis on women writers) are seamlessly brought together with historiography and lyricand the results continue to be arresting. The focal points of this book are the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce and his wife Juliette, whose full birth name and ancestry remain to this day somewhat of a mystery. For Howe, this mystery becomes a subtle metaphor for the frequently secondary quality the lives of women can take on in male-dominated milieux, literary or otherwise. The books first section, Arisbe, consists of a biographical essay and poems that touch on various aspects of Peirces life and work. The second, The Leisure of the Theory Class, is a long series of poems that tightly interweave references to Peirce, Juliette, George Meredith, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Charles Dickens, Edmund Husserls manuscripts, Alexander Popes translation of the Iliad and George Santayana, to name only the most prominent and explicit references. Reading and writing between the lines of history, Howe blurs the boundaries between individuals, texts and historical events. Though some of these relations may not appear obvious at first, they strengthenwhile continuing to proliferateas the poems unfold. The concluding Rckenfigur, a series of ghostly love poems, centers around the tragic myth of Tristram and Isolde. More overtly lyrical than the poems in the rest of the book, they provide a strong conclusion to one of Howes most significant works. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Where the Heart Is</h2><p>Talk about unlucky sevens. An hour ago, seventeen-year-old, seven months pregnant Novalee Nation was heading for California with her boyfriend. Now she finds herself stranded at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma, with just $7.77 in change. But Novalee is about to discover hidden treasures in this small Southwest town--a group of down-to-earth, deeply caring people willing to help a homeless, jobless girl living secretly in a Wal-Mart. From Bible-thumping blue-haired Sister Thelma Husband to eccentric librarian Forney Hull who loves Novalee more than she loves herself, they are about to take her--and you, too--on a moving, funny, and unforgettable journey to . . . Where the Heart Is.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, December 1998</b>: A funny thing happens to Novalee Nation on her way to Bakersfield, California. Her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willie Jack Pickens, abandons her in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart and takes off on his own, leaving her with just 10 dollars and the clothes on her back. Not that hard luck is anything new to Novalee, who is "seventeen, seven months pregnant, thirty-seven pounds overweight--and superstitious about sevens.... For most people, sevens were lucky. But not for her," Billie Letts writes. "She'd had a bad history with them, starting with her seventh birthday, the day Momma Nell ran away with a baseball umpire named Fred..."<p> Still, finding herself alone and penniless in Sequoyah, Oklahoma is enough to make even someone as inured to ill fortune as Novalee want to give up and die. Fortunately, the Wal-Mart parking lot is the Sequoyah equivalent of a town square, and within hours Novalee has met three people who will change her life: Sister Thelma Husband, a kindly eccentric; Benny Goodluck, a young Native American boy; and Moses Whitecotton, an elderly African American photographer. For the next two months, Novalee surreptitiously makes her home in the Wal-Mart, sleeping there at night, exploring the town by day. When she goes into labor and delivers her baby there, however, Novalee learns that sometimes it's not so bad to depend on the kindness of strangers--especially if one of them happens to be Sam Walton, the superchain's founder.</p><p> <i>Where the Heart Is</i> oddly mixes heart-warming vignettes and surprising, brutal violence. Novalee's story is juxtaposed with occasional chapters chronicling Willy Jack's downward spiral into prison, disappointment, and degradation. And even in Sequoyah, sudden storms, domestic violence, kidnapping, and deadly fires punctuate Novalee's progress from homeless, unwed teen mom to successful, happy member of the community. This is not a subtle book; there's never any doubt that our heroine will make a home for herself and her baby or that Willy Jack will get what he deserves for abandoning them. Still, Billie Letts has created several memorable characters, and there's always room for another novel that celebrates the life-affirming qualities of reading, the importance of education, and the power of love to change lives. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Billie Letts was the New York Times bestselling and award-winning author of <i>Where the Heart Is, The Honk and Holler Opening Soon, Shoot the Moon</i>, and <i>Made in the U.S.A</i>.

Mowat is dropped alone onto the frozen tundra, where he begins his mission to live among the howling wolf packs and study their waves. Contact with his quarry comes quickly, and Mowat discovers not a den of marauding killers but a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. As Mowat comes closer to the wolf world, he comes to fear with them on onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators out to erase the noble wolf community from the Arctic. <i>Never Cry Wolf</i> is one of the brilliant narratives on the myth and magical world of wild wolves and man's true place among the creatures of nature. "We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be -- the mythological epitome of a savage, ruthless killer -- which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself." -- from the new preface to <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>.</p><p><b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill.

Nevertheless, there must be a beginning to any tale; and the story of my sojourn amongst the wolves begins properly in Granny&#x2019;s bathroom.<br><br>When I was five years old I had still not given any indication &#x2013; as most gifted children do well before that age &#x2013; of where my future lay. Perhaps because they were disappointed by my failure to declare myself, my parents took me to Oakville and abandoned me to the care of my grandparents while they went off on a holiday.<br><br>The Oakville house &#x2013; &#x201c;Greenhedges&#x201d; it was called &#x2013; was a singularly genteel establishment, and I did not feel at home there. My cousin, who was resident in Greenhedges and was some years older than myself, had already found his m�tier, which lay in the military field, and had amassed a formidable army of lead soldiers with which he was single-mindedly preparing himself to become a second Wellington. My loutish inability to play Napoleon exasperated him so much that he refused to have anything to do with me except under the most formal circumstances.<br><br>Grandmother, an aristocratic lady of Welsh descent who had never forgiven her husband for having been a retail hardware merchant, tolerated me but terrified me too. She terrified most people, including Grandfather, who had long since sought surcease in assumed deafness. He used to while away the days as calm and unruffled as Buddha, ensconced in a great leather chair and apparently oblivious to the storms which swirled through the corridors of Greenhedges. And yet I know for a fact that he could hear the word &#x201c;whiskey&#x201d; if it was whispered in a room three stories removed from where he sat.<br><br>Because there were no soulmates for me at Greenhedges, I took to roaming about by myself, resolutely eschewing the expenditure of energy on anything even remotely useful; and thereby, if anyone had had the sense to see it, giving a perfectly clear indication of the pattern of my future.<br><br>One hot summer day I was meandering aimlessly beside a little local creek when I came upon a stagnant pool. In the bottom, and only just covered with green scum, three catfish lay gasping out their lives. They interested me. I dragged them up on the bank with a stick and waited expectantly for them to die; but this they refused to do. Just when I was convinced that they were quite dead, they would open their broad ugly jaws and give another gasp. I was so impressed by their stubborn refusal to accept their fate that I found a tin can, put them in it along with some scum, and took them home.<br><br>I had begun to like them, in an abstract sort of way, and wished to know them better. But the problem of where to keep them while our acquaintanceship ripened was a major one. There were no washtubs in Greenhedges. There <i>was</i> a bathtub, but the stopper did not fit and consequently it would not hold water for more than a few minutes. By bedtime I had still not resolved the problem and, since I felt that even these doughty fish could hardly survive an entire night in the tin can, I was driven to the admittedly desperate expedient of finding temporary lodgings for them in the bowl of Granny&#x2019;s old-fashioned toilet.<br><br>I was too young at the time to appreciate the special problems which old age brings in its train. It was one of these problems which was directly responsible for the dramatic and unexpected encounter which took place between my grandmother and the catfish during the small hours of the ensuing night.<br><br>It was a traumatic experience for Granny, and for me, and probably for the catfish too. Throughout the rest of her life Granny refused to eat fish of any kind, and always carried a high-powered flashlight with her during her nocturnal peregrinations. I cannot be as certain about the effect on the catfish, for my unfeeling cousin &#x2013; once the hooferaw had died down a little &#x2013; callously flushed the toilet. As for myself, the effect was to engender in me a lasting affinity for the lesser beasts of the animal kingdom. In a word, the affair of the catfish marked the beginning of my career, first as a naturalist, and later as a biologist. I had started on my way to the wolf den.<br><br>My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammalogist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it &#x2013; a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs.<br>Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammalogist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.)<br>My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.<br><br>For a time I debated whether or not to follow the lead of a friend of mine who was specializing in scatology &#x2013; the study of the excretory droppings of animals &#x2013; and who later became a high-ranking scatologist with the United States Biological Survey. But although I found the subject mildly interesting, it failed to rouse my enthusiasm to the pitch where I could wish to make it my lifework. Besides, the field was overcrowded.<br><br>My personal predelictions lay towards studies of living animals in their own habitat. Being a literal fellow, I took the word <i>biology &#x2013; </i>which means the study of life &#x2013; at its face value. I was sorely puzzled by the paradox that many of my contemporaries tended to shy as far away from living things as they could get, and chose to restrict themselves instead to the aseptic atmosphere of laboratories where they used dead &#x2013; often very dead &#x2013; animal material as their subject matter. In fact, during my time at the university it was becoming unfashionable to have <i>anything</i> to do with animals, even dead ones. The new biologists were concentrating on statistical and analytical research, whereby the raw material of life became no more than fodder for the nourishment of calculating machines.<br><br>My inability to adjust to the new trends had an adverse effect upon my professional expectations. While my fellow students were already establishing themselves in various esoteric specialties, most of which they invented for themselves on the theory that if you are the <i>only</i> specialist in a given field you need fear no competition, I was still unable to deflect my interests from the general to the particular. As graduation approached I found that the majority of my contemporaries were assured of excellent research jobs while I seemed to have nothing particular to offer in the biological marketplace. It was, therefore, inevitable that I should end up working for the Government.<br><br>The die was cast one winter&#x2019;s day when I received a summons from the Dominion Wildlife Service informing me that I had been hired at the munificent salary of one hundred and twenty dollars a month, and that I &#x201c;would&#x201d; report to Ottawa at once.<br><br>I obeyed this peremptory order with hardly more than a twitch of subdued rebelliousness, for if I had learned anything during my years at the university it was that the scientific hierarchy requires a high standard of obedience, if not subservience, from its acolytes.<br><br>Two days later I arrived in the windswept, gray-souled capital of Canada and found my way into the dingy labyrinth which housed the Wildlife Service. Here I presented myself to the Chief Mammalogist, whom I had known as a school chum in more carefree days. But alas, he had now metamorphosed into a full-blown scientist, and was so shrouded in professional dignity that it was all I could do to refrain from making him a profound obeisance.<br><br>Through the next several days I was subjected to something called &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; &#x2013; a process which, so far as I could see, was designed to reduce me to a malleable state of hopeless depression. At any rate, the legions of Dantesque bureaucrats whom I visited in their gloomy, Formalin-smelling dens, where they spent interminable hours compiling dreary data or originating meaningless memos, did nothing to rouse in me much devotion to my new employment. The only thing I actually <i>learned</i> during this period was that, by comparison with the bureaucratic hierarchy in Ottawa, the scientific hierarchy was a brotherhood of anarchy.<br><br>This was driven home one memorable day when, having at last been certified as fit for inspection, I was paraded into the office of the Deputy Minister, where I so far forgot myself as to address him as &#x201c;Mister.&#x201d; My escort of the moment, all white-faced and trembling, immediately rushed me out of the Presence and took me by devious ways to the men&#x2019;s washroom. Having first knelt down and peered under the doors of all the cubicles to make absolutely certain we were alone and could not be overheard, he explained in an agonized whisper that I must never, on pain of banishment, address the Deputy as anything but &#x201c;Chief,&#x201d; or, barring that, by his Boer War title of &#x201c;Colonel.&#x201d;<br><br>Military titles were <i>de rigeur</i>. All memos were signed Captain-this or Lieutenant-that if they originated from the lower echelons; or Colonel-this and Brigadier-that if they came down from on high. Those members of the staff who had not had the opportunity to acquire even quasi-military status were reduced to the expedient of inventing suitable ranks &#x2013; field ranks if they were senior men, and subaltern ranks for the juniors. Not everyone took this matter with due solemnity, and I met one new employee in the fishery section who distinguished himself briefly by sending a memo up to the Chief signed &#x201c;J. Smith, Acting Lance-Corporal.&#x201d; A week later this foolhardy youth was on his way to the northernmost tip of Ellesmere Island, there to spend his exile living in an igloo while studying the life history of the nine-spined stickleback.<br>Levity was not looked upon with favor anywhere in those austere offices, as I discovered for myself while attending a conference concerning my first assignment.<br><br>A tentative list of the material requirements for this assignment lay on the conference table, surrounded by many grave countenances. It was a formidable document, made out in quintuplicate &#x2013; as was the official rule &#x2013; and imposingly headed:<br><br>DESIDERATA FOR THE LUPINE PROJECT<br><br>Having already been unnerved by the gravity of the gathering, I lost my head completely when the assembly began to consider the twelfth item listed in this horrendous document:<br><br><i>Paper, toilet, Government standard: 12 rolls</i>.<br>An austere suggestion by the representative of the Finance Department that, in the interest of economy, the quantity of this item might be reduced, providing the field party (which was me) exercised all due restraint, sent me into an hysterical spasm of giggling. I mastered myself almost instantly, but it was too late. The two most senior men, both &#x201c;majors,&#x201d; rose to their feet, bowed coldly, and left the room without a word.<br><br>The Ottawa ordeal drew toward its end; but the climax was still to come. One early spring morning I was called to the office of the senior officer who was my direct chief, for a final interview before departing &#x201c;into the field.&#x201d;<br><br>My chief sat behind a massive desk whose dusty surface was littered with yellowing groundhog skulls (he had been studying rates of tooth decay in groundhogs ever since he joined the Department in 1897). At his back hung the frowning, bearded portrait of an extinct mammalogist who glared balefully down upon me. The smell of Formalin swirled about like the fetid breath of an undertaker&#x2019;s back parlor.<br><br>After a long silence, during which he toyed portentously with some of his skulls, my chief began his briefing. There was a solemnity about the occasion which would have done justice to the briefing of a special agent about to be entrusted with the assassination of a Head of State.<br><br>&#x201c;As you are aware, Lieutenant Mowat,&#x201d; my chief began, &#x201c;the <i>Canis lupus</i> problem has become one of national importance. Within this past year alone this Department has received no less than thirty-seven memoranda from Members of the House of Commons, all expressing the deep concern of their constituents that we ought to do something about the wolf. Most of the complaints have come from such civic-minded and disinterested groups as various Fish and Game clubs, while members of the business community &#x2013; in particular the manufacturers of some well-known brands of ammunition &#x2013; have lent their weight to the support of these legitimate grievances of the voting public of this Great Dominion, because their grievance is the complaint that the wolves are killing all the deer, and more and more of our fellow citizens are coming back from more and more hunts with less and less deer.<br><br>&#x201c;As you may possibly have heard, my predecessor supplied the Minister with an explanation of this situation in which it was his contention that there were fewer deer because the hunters had increased to the point where they outnumbered the deer about five to one. The Minister, in all good faith, read this fallacious statement in the House of Commons, and he was promptly shouted down by Members howling &#x2018;Liar!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Wolf-lover!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;Three days later my predecessor retired to civilian life, and the Minister issued a press statement: &#x2018;The Department of Mines and Resources is determined to do everything in its power to curb the carnage being wreaked upon the deer population by hordes of wolves. A full-scale investigation of this vital problem, employing the full resources of the Department, is to be launched at once. The people of this country can rest assured that the Government of which I have the honor to be a member will leave no stone unturned to put an end to this intolerable situation.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>At this ju...</p><h2>Classic Fishing Lures and Tackle: An Entertaining History of Collectible Fishing Gear</h2><p><p>An entertaining overview of vintage fishing gear, this book takes you back in time to fishing's golden age.

The first is a rich, satisfying, nonhorrific tale about an innocent man who carefully nurtures hope and devises a wily scheme to escape from prison. The second concerns a boy who discards his innocence by enticing an old man to travel with him into a reawakening of long-buried evil. In the third story, a writer looks back on the trek he took with three friends on the brink of adolescence to find another boy's corpse. The trip becomes a character-rich rite of passage from youth to maturity.<p> These first three novellas have been made into well-received movies: "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" into Frank Darabont's 1994 <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (available as a screenplay, a DVD film, and an audiocassette), "Apt Pupil" into Bryan Singer's 1998 film <i>Apt Pupil</i> (also released in 1998 on audiocassette), and "The Body" into Rob Reiner's <i>Stand by Me</i> (1986).</p><p> The final novella, "Breathing Lessons," is a horror yarn told by a doctor, about a patient whose indomitable spirit keeps her baby alive under extraordinary circumstances. It's the tightest, most polished tale in the collection. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>STEPHEN KING is a master of the novella and short narrative form.

This titanic building, the main dormitory of Moscow State University, is a monument of the pompous and energetic style of architecture nicknamed &#x201c;Stalin Gothic.&#x201d; Seen from a distance, it suggests a Disney version of a ziggurat; its central spire, like the Kremlin towers, holds a blinking red star. Inside, as in a medieval fortress, there is everything necessary to sustain life in case of siege: bakeries, a dairy store, a fruit and vegetable store, a pharmacy, a post office, magazine kiosks, a watch-repair stand&#x2014;all this in addition to classrooms, and student rooms, and cafeterias. On the outside, it bristles with a daft excess of decoration that is a strange twentieth-century mixture of Babylonian, Corinthian, and Slavic: there are outsized bronze flags and statues, fa�ence curlicues, wrought-iron sconces&#x2014;even a vast reflecting pool decorated with metal water lilies the size of small cabbages. As I climb the endless stairs and negotiate the labyrinth of fusty-smelling hallways, I feel dwarfed and apprehensive, a human being lost in a palace scaled for giants.<br><br> I came to this odd new home with my husband on a summer evening two days ago, when exhaustion from long-distance travel gave every new sight the mysterious simplicity and resonance of a dream. I had my first glimpse of the Soviet Union as we broke through a cloud barrier near Sheremetyevo Airport, and found ourselves flying low over a forest of birch and evergreen, dotted with countless small ponds. There was an almost magical lushness and secrecy about this flattish northern landscape that I found powerfully attractive; suddenly I remembered that my earliest visions of Russia were of an infinite forest, dark as any forest that stretches through a child&#x2019;s imagination, and peopled by swan maidens, hunter princes, fabulous bears, and witches who lived in huts set on chicken legs. Tied to Russia by no claims of blood or tradition, I still felt, while very young, an obscure attraction to this country that I knew only from its violent, highly colored folklore; its music, through which ran a similar vein of extravagance; and the dark political comments of adults. It seemed to me to be a mysterious counterweight to the known world of America&#x2014;a country, like the land at the back of the north wind, in which life ran backward and the fantastic was commonplace.<br><br> Our disembarkment and passage through customs at Sheremetyevo were standard chaos, involving a long, dazed wait in a crowded room traversed from time to time by hot breezes smelling sweetly of cut grass. Only one memory remains with me from those hours: the sight of a Pioneer* excursion group of twenty small girls who seemed, by their Asiatic faces and straight black hair, to be Siberian. They all wore the blue shorts, white shirts, and red neckerchiefs that I had seen in pictures, as well as ornately curled hair bows that gave them a queer geisha look, and as I studied them with the dreamy precision of fatigue, all twenty stared back at me with an avid, unadorned curiosity. Standing beyond the customs barrier was a young man who introduced himself in English as Grigorii, a journalism student sent to meet us by the university&#x2019;s office of foreign affairs. Grigorii was a dark-haired young man in his twenties, with very small eyes behind enormous round glasses and a pinched, rather gnomish body in a large, baggy suit; the impression he gave was that he had melted down slightly inside his clothing. He led us outside to a black Volga, a Soviet car that looks like a cross between a Rambler and a Plymouth. A short-legged driver, wearing a checked cap pulled down very far over his ears, stowed our bags, and soon we were speeding down a road with the vaguely horrifying sense of freedom one feels only when going through absolutely strange territory in a strange car. It was dark by now, and the smell of fields and forest rushed in through the windows. Grigorii had discovered that we both spoke Russian, and had grown garrulous. &#x201c;So you are a student of Russian history?&#x201d; he was saying to Tom. &#x201c;I myself am extremely interested in American history&#x2014;especially in your Civil War. Two years ago I even wrote a paper on the Great Barbecue.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The what?&#x201d; asked Tom.<br><br> &#x201c;The Great Barbecue&#x2014;the turning point of the Reconstruction period. Don&#x2019;t tell me you haven&#x2019;t heard of it!&#x201d; (Grigorii pronounced the word &#x201c;barbecue&#x201d; with the gleeful relish of a Frenchman saying &#x201c;Marlboro.&#x201d;)<br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Tom, and as the car slid through the darkness, Grigorii illuminated for us this lost part of American history, mentioning feudal remnants, the industrial bourgeoisie, and the struggle of the working class. Listening to his small, dry, pedantic voice mention names and places I&#x2019;d never heard of, I wondered what Marxist looking-glass we&#x2019;d stepped through. Where on earth were we? Was he talking about the same America we had just left?<br><br> When the monstrous silhouette of the university tower appeared on the skyline, Grigorii paused to point it out proudly. &#x201c;Impressive, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the most luxurious dormitory in the Soviet Union&#x2014;every year hundreds of tourists come to visit it. It&#x2019;s a city block in circumference; some other time I will give you the figures on its height and number of windows. I&#x2019;m sorry that we won&#x2019;t be passing the reflecting pool tonight, but there is a very handsome giant barometer that I will show you. I feel very lucky to live there. We&#x2019;ll be neighbors, so to speak!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hurrah!&#x201d; I whispered to Tom, and he dug his elbow into my ribs. Then we sat silently as the black tower grew larger against the sky.<br><br> Our arrival meant passing through a gatehouse, climbing a great many stairs, crossing a chilly marble hall, and threading through a maze of corridors on a path that led at last to a long ride in an elevator, and some kind of fuss with an old woman over a key. Although it was only about nine o&#x2019;clock in the evening, a charmed stillness seemed to reign in the dormitory; we saw very few students. Instead, there seemed to be inordinate numbers of babushki&#x2014;old women&#x2014;in semi-official posts, knitting and nodding in dark corners like watchful beldames out of a Grimms tale. The babushka of the keys, a tiny creature with a fierce squint under a cowled white shawl, watched us struggle with the door to our room and then turned to whisper portentously to a still smaller companion, Ischo Amerikantsy&#x2014;More Americans.<br><br> When Grigorii left us, we flicked a switch, and in the sudden bright light, faced our living quarters for the year. They were what Russians call a blok&#x2014;a minute suite consisting of two rooms about six feet by ten feet each, a tiny entryway, and a pair of cubicles containing, between them, a toilet, a shower and washstand, and several large, indolent cockroaches. The two main rooms were painted the dispiriting beige and green of institutional rooms around the world, and furnished, rather nicely, with varnished chairs, tables, bookcases, and two single beds. (I&#x2019;ve since discovered that our rooms represent great luxury, since Russian students in the same building often live four and six to such quarters.) Each room held a radio that tuned in to only one station&#x2014;Radio Moscow&#x2014;and at this particular moment, news was being broadcast by a woman with an excited, throaty voice. &#x201c;Today,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;the Party Government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Comrades Le Duan and Pham Van Dong visited the Kirovsky factory in Leningrad . . . In front of the monument to V. I. Lenin in Factory Square, there took place a meeting of Soviet-Vietnamese friendship . . . The Leningraders arrived at the meeting with flowers, red flags, and signs in honor of the unbreakable friendship . . . The people gathering together greeted the emissaries of the heroic Vietnamese people with warm applause . . .&#x201d;<br><br> The news went off, and on came a medley of Komsomol songs delivered stalwartly by what sounded like an entire nation of ruddy-cheeked young patriots. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t turn this thing off,&#x201d; said Tom, fiddling with the radio knob. Indeed, like one of Orwell&#x2019;s telescreens, our official radios could be turned down to inaudible, but never turned off.

These injuries from others can range from passive hurtful comments to intentional abusive assaults. The end result is that our sense of being a cohesive and secure self is threatened. We may begin to experience degrees of vulnerability and self-doubts, or of rage and desire for revenge. We may even feel as if we were &#34;falling apart&#34; In all cases these self-injuries chip away at our self-cohesion and self-esteem. Grace for the Injured Self helps us to better understand the significance of these injuries to our self, as well as how these injuries can be healed through the self psychology approach of Heinz Kohut. Throughout its pages, this book emphasizes the empathic presence of another as a source of grace. Empathy is the most powerful means by which the self is reassured, strengthened, and ultimately restored. It is this empathic responsiveness of others that holds our self together and helps us daily maintain our self-cohesion and self-esteem. The self psychology perspective of Heinz Kohut, who many consider the most significant psychoanalyst since Sigmund Freud, is made available here as a primary means by which clergy and other helping professionals can provide a healing context for the restoration of injured selves.</p><p>Terry D.

A striking study that takes techniques to a new level; live models, wearing an enormous range of authentic surviving uniforms.

Henry is a former college administrator and has lived in Alaska for 30 years. She spends much of her spare time RVing around the Lower Forty-eight or researching Alaska.Jessica Fletcher and Miss Marple aren't the only seniors who solve mysteries these days. Now, there's sexagenarian Maxie McNabb, an ordinary gal who travels around the country in a motor home accompanied by her dachshund, Stretch, meeting different people and seeing the sites. Taos, Maxie's current stop, affords her the opportunity to visit a local weaving shop, which, in a roundabout way, results in her opening her home to troubled Shirley Morgan. Then Shirley disappears without a word, and Maxie finds herself in possession of something Shirley left behind--. Unfortunately, somebody wants what Shirley left, and Maxie has no idea what it is. Maxie's sleuthing is more idle curiosity that actual investigation, but the laid-back approach has its own charms, and Henry give readers a grand slice of America's southwestern landscape (a far cry from the Alaskan setting of her Jessie Arnold series). Maxie is a pleasant heroine who not only acts her age but also loves her life and rises to the occasion when the occasion finally arises. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Or that the invention of the bicycle directly, and poorly, impacted sales of cheddar? Or that some of the first cheese makers hid gold coins inside their wheels of dairy as a sales tool?</p><p><em>Brethren, the writer calls you this because he hopes that you are &#x2018;cheese-minded&#x2019; like himself.</em></p><p>This classic and charming book, a timeless love letter to English cheeses was first published in 1937, newly rediscovered and charmingly illustrated by EH Shepard. It is a treasure trove of wonderful anecdotes including the tale of the monstrous cheese big enough to hold a 13-year-old inside, the Stilton that purred like a cat and the famous cheesemaker in Manchester who selected which Cheshire cheese to sell based on where the mice had been nibbling &#x2018;as they were the best judges of a good cheese&#x2019;.</p><p>Sir John Squire, a notable journalist of the time, collected together &#x2018;a galaxy of talent&#x2019;, with the aim of making this &#x2018;one of the most delightful and entertaining gift books that has ever been published&#x2019;. Each of the distinguished ten contributors champion an individual cheese, setting forward their passionate and compelling arguments, celebrating the differences and delights of each type. Through their explorations, the chequered beauties of the English landscape unfolds.</p><p>It will certainly whet the appetite for English cheese, for that is ultimately what matters most, as after all &#x2018;the only way to learn about cheese is to eat it.&#x2019;</p></p><p><p>Sir John Collings Squire&nbsp;(1884 &#x2013;1958) was Editor and founder of The London Mercury. He established himself as a talker, drinker, habitu� of clubs, and man about town. His championship of English cheeses reflected a lifelong love of all things rural and traditional. All these were threatened by modern life and Squire fought for their preservation in verse and prose. The cheese board was a battleground in miniature. His homage to English cheese also reflected his desire not to take the snobbery of French gastronomy too seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a rare treat, a rediscovered gem.

They are everywhere, down narrow streets and in brightly lit office buildings and parliaments, dominating family life, crowding prisons and law courts, and providing plots for most of the works of fiction that have been composed since the dawn of history." Now, in the ultimate rogue's gallery, Mortimer (best known as the author of <em>Rumpole of the Bailey</em>) has captured an arresting collection of crooks, murderers, seducers, con men, traitors, and tyrants--the world's greatest villains, both fictional and real.<br> Here readers who love mayhem (at least in print) will find villainy in all its shapes and sizes, from pickpockets and pirates to tyrants and financiers. Billy the Kid rubs shoulders with Mac the Knife, Captain Hook with Casanova, Caligula with Rasputin, Fagin with Dr Fu-Manchu. There are master criminals (such as Dr No, Raffles, or Professor Moriarty), minor miscreants (such as P.G. Wodehouse's Ferdie the Fly, "who, while definitely not of the intelligentsia, had the invaluable gift of being able to climb up the side of any house you placed before him, using only toes, fingers and personal magnetism"), and bumbling incompetents (such as Peter Scott, a Briton who in 1980 made seven attempts to kill his wife, without her once noticing that anything was wrong). We meet the soft-spoken murderer Armstrong, a gentle small-town lawyer, whose manners were so good that when he passed his intended victim a poisoned scone he uttered the immortal words, "Excuse my fingers." And we listen as Marlowe, in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, remembers Kurtz's report to the Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs--"This was the unbounded power of eloquence--of words--of burning noble words"--and the scrawled postscript, added much later, that hit Marlowe "like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!'" In addition, there is an account of the death of Billy the Kidd, written by Jorge Luis Borges, and another of the tax evasion trial of Al Capone, by Damon Runyon. Mortimer has in fact ranged high and low, taking excerpts from the greats of literature--from the Bible, Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton (where Lucifer has all the best lines, such as "Better to reign in hell, than serve in heav'n"), Moliere, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Hardy, Trollope, Mark Twain, and many others--and from the leading detective and mystery writers--including Eric Ambler, Dick Francis, Wilkie Collins, James M. Cain, Patricia Highsmith, Ian Fleming, Angela Carter, and Arthur Conan Doyle.<br> Attractive scoundrels and incompetent rogues, calculating murderers and unscrupulous swinders pack these pages with a richness and variety that will by turns delight, surprise and chill.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>John Mortimer</strong> is author of <em>Rumpole of the Bailey</em>, the Leslie Titmuss books, <em>Voyage Round My Father</em>, and other volumes.<br>`absorbing...[a] hugely entertaining anthology' J.

But in the course of a busy day, it's hard to find the many hours needed to prepare traditional yeast breads. </p><p> Now, with <b>125 Best Quick Bread Recipes</b>, bestselling baking experts Donna Washburn and Heather Butt provide the perfect solution for anyone who wants to enjoy homemade bread in a hurry. Unlike conventional breads, which require yeast to rise before baking, quick breads get their lightness and texture from baking soda and baking powder. As a result, there's no waiting -- just mix the dough, pour it into a pan and bake! </p><p> With the recipes in this book, you can prepare a tantalizing range of breads, biscuits, loaves and snacking cakes using only a few simple steps. Baking times range from 10 minutes to just over an hour. There's no easier or faster way to enjoy savory treats such as <i>Broccoli Cheddar Cornbread</i> or <i>Rosemary Scones Topped with Carmelized Vidalias</i>, or decadent dessert loaves like <i>Macadamia White Chocolate Chip Bread</i>. Here you'll also find classic comfort foods such as <i>Golden Raisin Bread</i> and <i>Gingerbread with Warm Lemon Sauce</i>, as well as hearty favorites like <i>Country Harvest Loaf</i>. </p><p> For people with special dietary needs, there are chapters devoted to gluten-free and low-fat quick breads. And if you have a bread machine with a "quick bread," "cake" or "batter bread" cycle, you'll find recipes that are designed to take advantage of this feature. </p><p> As you'd expect from Donna and Heather, the recipes in this book are as imaginative and delicious as they are quick and easy to make. It's the perfect collection for anyone -- novice or expert -- who loves to bake. </p></p><p><p> <b>Donna Washburn</b> and <b>Heather Butt</b> are professional home economists and baking experts. They are the bestselling authors of <i>America's Best Bread Machine Baking Recipes</i> and <i>More of America's Best Bread Machine Baking Recipes</i> (because of difference in flours between the countries both books are also available in "Canada's Best..." editions). </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p> <p> When our publisher first approached us about developing quick bread recipes for this book, we were overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices. After all, what are quick breads? Well, they offer the same fresh-from-the-oven flavor as traditional yeast breads, and don't require a lot of preparation and baking time. But that's where the similarities end. Quick breads can include everything from savory breads to sweet loaves, from biscuits to pancakes -- suitable for serving at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Our challenge was to come up with a selection of recipes that explored all these wonderfully flavorful possibilities. </p><p> Our savory selections include breads that incorporate a wide selection of seasonal ingredients (try our <i>Bacon'n'Tomato Herb Loaf</i> [page 15] or <i>Broccoli Cheddar Cornbread</i> [page 16]), as well as international favorites, such as <i>Mediterranean Loaf</i> (page 32) or <i>Russian Blini</i> (page 33). Another chapter is devoted to quick breads that feature hearty and healthy combinations of grains and nuts, such as <i>Parmesan Walnut Bread</i> (page 42) and <i>Wild Rice and Cranberry Loaf</i> (page 52). All of these breads are delicious on their own or as a complement to a bowl of hot soup, a crisp salad or a hearty stew. </p><p> For many people (ourselves included), the term "quick breads" is synonymous with sweet loaves -- taken hot from the oven and cooled overnight to increase their moisture for easier slicing. (At least, that's the traditional rationale; we suspect the "overnight" rule may have been invented just to ensure that some would be left for the next day!) And certainly a book like this one would be incomplete without recipes for sweet loaves such as <i>Banana Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake</i> (page 69) or <i>Prune and Apricot Bread</i> (page 111). </p><p> We have also included recipes for biscuits, cobblers, cr�pes, waffles and pancakes. The quick and easy basics are here, including <i>Cheddar Dill Biscuits</i> (page 55) and <i>Buttermilk Waffles</i> (page 85), but we have developed new flavors just for you. Try the <i>Fresh Tomato Basil Drop Biscuits</i> (page 59) or the <i>Three Fruit Cobbler</i> (page 64). Both will quickly become family favorites. </p><p> If you're watching your diet, you can still enjoy the great flavor of quick breads. Here you'll find fat-reduced recipes such as <i>Low-Fat Applesauce Raisin Bread</i> (page 117). And for all the people who are looking for gluten-free bread recipes (and judging from all the calls and enquiries posted on our website, there are many of you), we've written a special chapter with gluten-free versions of some of our favorite quick breads. We've discovered that their texture, flavor and nutritive value often exceeds that of the "white flour" originals. Even if your diet isn't restricted, they re worth a try. </p><p> For those of you who know us from our previous bread machine baking books, we've adapted many of the flavors from those cookbooks for these easy-to-prepare breads. In fact, you might recognize some of the names and flavor combinations, such as our <i>Bread Machine Country Harvest Quick Bread</i> (page 158). These recipes are specially designed to take advantage of the "quick bread cycle" now featured on many bread machines. </p><p> Finally, we've dedicated a chapter to traditional quick breads. (After all, tradition is such an important part of baking!) And here we revisit some of the loaves and biscuits that we remember enjoying so much on visits to our grandmothers' homes, with updated versions of <i>Banana Bread</i> (page 169), so fragrant and crunchy with walnuts; <i>Lemon Loaf with Lemon Glaze</i> (page 172), almost soggy with its luscious lemon glaze; thick slices of <i>Date Nut Bread</i> (page 170), dark and sweet, spread with butter; and, of course, <i>Zucchini Bread</i> (page 175), a harvest-time classic. </p><p> We continue to be delighted by all the people who tell us how much they love the recipes in our bread machine cookbooks. And we hope you'll enjoy this collection of recipes just as much. We created them just for you -- our fellow bakers! </p><p> Donna and Heather </p><p> &nbsp; </p></p><h2>Hitler : A Study in Tyranny ( Harper Perennial Library, P 216)</h2><p>The classic biography of Hitler that remains, years after its publication, one of the most authoritative and readable accounts of his life.

Updated and expanded from 2004's Phases of the Moon, this mammoth collection contains twenty-six stories and novellas, along with a generous amount of introductory material. The result is the definitive one-volume overview of an extraordinary career.<br><br>The earliest story, 'The Macauley Circuit,' was published in 1957, the latest, 'The Prisoner,' in 2010. In between these narrative bookends are some of the most astonishing fictional creations of the modern era, many of them winners of major awards. Included among these are 'Good News from the Vatican,' 'Sailing to Byzantium,' 'Passengers,' and 'Enter a Soldier. Later, Enter Another,' as well as two of the most remarkable novellas you will ever encounter: 'Nightwings' and 'Born with the Dead.' Supplementing these award-winners are such bona fide classics as 'Sundance,' 'Schwartz Between the Galaxies,' 'Capricorn Games,' and 'To See the Invisible Man.' And the list goes on. Intelligent, exhilarating, and endlessly re-readable, The Best of Robert Silverberg: Stories of Six Decades is an irreplaceable volume, one that no one with an interest in modern science fiction--or in serious, ambitious fiction of any sort--can afford to miss.</p><p>Starred Review. This well-chosen retrospective, which adds three stories to the 2004 limited-edition collection Phases of the Moon, spans 56 years of SFWA Grand Master Silverberg's writing life, starting in his early career with 1954's The Road to Nightfall and ending with 2010's The Prisoner. In 26 elegantly conceived and written stories, protagonists travel through time, philosophize, question their morals and faith, and pursue unknowable, elusive women. The narrator of Nightwings endures a crisis of faith over his order's age-old vigil against alien invasion. In The Far Side of the Bell-Shaped Curve a time traveler tries to manipulate his time line to keep the woman he desires. A bereaved husband in Born with the Dead pursues his wife beyond death to her very peculiar afterlife. Francisco Pizarro and Socrates engage in a battle of wits in Enter a Soldier. Later, Enter Another. Thanks to Silverberg's commentary on each decade and story&#x2014;wry, candid, and unencumbered by false modesty&#x2014;the anthology also functions as a memoir of a great career in genre literature.

To All Our Children describes in extensive detail the process of wanting to leave one&#39;s home and extended family, making preparations for emigrating, saying farewell, embarking on ships (which in some cases were nothing more than troop transport ships) and the misery of seasickness, to sighting land and stepping off the boat for new adventures on foreign soil among people who spoke a different language and had &#34;strange&#34; traditions and ways.</p><p></p><h2>The Secret History of Moscow</h2><p><ul> <li>Every city contains secret places. Moscow in the tumultuous 1990s is no different, its citizens seeking safety in a world below the streets &#x2015; a dark, cavernous world of magic, weeping trees, and albino jackdaws, where exiled pagan deities and faery-tale creatures whisper strange tales to those who would listen. Galina is a young woman caught, like her contemporaries, in the seeming lawlessness of the new Russia. In the midst of this chaos, her sister Maria turns into a jackdaw and flies away &#x2015; prompting Galina to join Yakov, a policeman investigating a rash of recent disappearances. Their search will take them to the underground realm of hidden truths and archetypes, to find themselves caught between reality and myth, past and present, honor and betrayal . . . the secret history of Moscow.</li></ul></p><p>Sedia (<i>According to Crow</i>) applies urban fantasy templates to her Russian setting with mixed success in her second stand-alone novel. Masha, the cheerfully normal sister of vision-prone translator Galina, turns into a jackdaw and flies off, leaving her just-born child behind. Joined by police detective Yakov Richards, Galina tracks the missing Masha into an underground milieu where lost souls mingle with beings out of Russian folklore. A host of secondary characters rapidly clutter the narrative and cloud its focus, and Sedia's persistently curt prose favors contemporary atmosphere over mythic resonance, diminishing Koschey the Deathless and Zemun the Celestial Cow to near-mundane status. Modern blue-collar Moscow is pitch-perfect, however: bustling yet seedy, disorganized and none too respectable. While undeniably authentic, the cynical tone may alienate many Western readers before they reach the startling but well-grounded climax. On the whole, this wholeheartedly Russian tale is most compelling as social commentary. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the Third Reich targeted Europe's Jews for deportation and death, confusion and mistrust reigned. What were Hitler's aims? Did Germany's rapid early victories mark the start of an enduring new era? Was collaboration or resistance the wisest response to occupation? How far should solidarity and empathy extend? And where was God? People desperately tried to understand the horrors around them, but the stories they told themselves often justified a selfish indifference to their neighbors' fates. <br>Piecing together the broken words of the war's witnesses and victims, Fritzsche offers a haunting picture of the most violent conflict in modern history.</p><p><b>Peter Fritzsche</b> is the W.

Among her many awards are two Newberys and two National Book Awards, and she was recently named a "Living Legend&#x201d; by the Library of Congress. She has been published in more than 22 languages in a variety of formats, from picture books to historical novels.</p>Grade 2-6-- Finding a princess who is the ``king's equal'' in comeliness, intelligence, and wealth is an order that confounds the wisest, most loyal councilors in this distant realm. Finding a book equal in quality and brilliance to this one is an even more formidable task. Paterson weaves her story within the structure of familiar fairy tales; she includes romance, repetition of language, the number three, and a moral of goodness and love triumphing over selfishness and greed. Her careful attention to the beauty and variety of descriptive language is evident on every page. The story gains dimension with the inclusion of ``the Wolf.'' At first glimpse, he seems a menacing, negative force, but he is revealed ultimately to be the purveyor of magic, and even the perfect matchmaker. He never intrudes upon court life in the capital city, but remains in his remote mountain lair, an enigmatic character to ponder at the story's end. Vagin's illustrations are exquisite, luminous in color, clarity, and precision. Readers are drawn into the courtly world of a wealthy kingdom through details of costume, architecture, furniture, and decorations. Because there are six chapters, the book is a lengthy read-aloud. This is, however, no drawback; young listeners will be a spellbound and appreciative audience, and should want to return to the book again and again. --Martha Rosen, Edgewood School, Scarsdale, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Summer of My Amazing Luck</h2><p><i>A Novel by the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award&#x2014;winning author of </i><b>A Complicated Kindness<br></b><br>Lucy Van Alstyne always thought she&#x2019;d grow up to become a forest ranger.

And, to get all psychoanalytical about it, I&#x2019;ve been trying to understand my father for a long time now, and I think that in my own life, growing up, etcetera, my mother was sort of this buffer between him and me, in that she kind of protected me from his sadness and tried to make life fun and upbeat all the time. So maybe, in order for my character to understand her father better, and assuming that my characters are in some ways me, that particular buffer has to be removed.&#x201d;<b>One</b><br><br>Lish had been a lifer even before the trouble started with Serenity Place. She had four daughters, two of them with the same guy and the other two, twins, with a carefree street performer who had fallen in love with Lish&#x2019;s hands. Perfect for balls, he&#x2019;d said, juggling them that is. Now jugglers never make cracks about balls, Lish informed me, they just don&#x2019;t. Lish knew a lot about the theatre, about working a room, drawing a crowd, about blocking and leading, about the superstitions of theatre people. She had always loved the stage. Or the street, or wherever it is that people perform. She had met the juggler in the hospitality suite of the hotel at which all the performers were staying. Volunteering, for Lish, was a good way to meet theatre people without violating welfare rules, and it was a nice break from the kids. This street performer, absent father of the twins, said he loved Lish and suggested that she join him on the road. He could teach her to eat fire, juggle knives, walk on stilts. He showed her a newspaper clipping of himself from <i>The Miami Herald</i> and the headline was &#x201c;Magic, Music and Tomfoolery,&#x201d; and then there was a photo of him breaking a chain with his �chest.<br><br>Just like Zampano in &#x201c;La Strada,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said. Lish was giddy with the proposition and the free booze of the hospitality suite, and so she agreed to join him on the road, on the condition that she could bring her daughters, numbering two at the time. &#x201c;Not a problem, not a problem,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll bring in more cash,&#x201d; and then he made a red handkerchief disappear up Lish&#x2019;s nose. And, of course, reappear. Something he himself had failed to do after impregnating Lish in his hotel room that night, while her long beautiful hands caressed his oily back and the hot summer night got hotter. Lish found him irresistible with his sad eyes and his �world-�weary bearing and silly jokes that in and of themselves weren&#x2019;t funny at all, but when he said them seemed, at least to Lish, to define comedy. And Lish loved to laugh. What was funniest though to Lish was his utter seriousness about �sex.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t say a word or crack a smile throughout, and Lish had to pretend that a snort of laughter she let escape while he focussed in on the homestretch was really an uncontrollable gasp of pleasure. She had hoped he&#x2019;d think it was her unusual way of expressing herself while in the throes of passion. Snorting. But she wasn&#x2019;t sure. In any case, it didn&#x2019;t matter. The next morning while Lish slept sated and pregnant with not one but two of the busker&#x2019;s babies, he made himself, along with Lish&#x2019;s cotton purse, disappear for good. Lish said he had left a note that said &#x201c;Catcha on the flip side.&#x201d; Can you believe it? Lish said his juggling was much better than his �writing.<br><br>For a while Lish wondered if her snorting had made him leave, but really she knew that it hadn&#x2019;t been her, it had been the road, and there was nothing she or anyone else could do about it. Some people were just like that. All the road had to do was look up at them and they were gone. Poof. And so it was with the father of her twins. She wished she had found out what his name was, but hey . . . Lish was the kind of person who enjoyed telling this tale to people. It was romantic, reckless. And if the twins asked about their dad, she could build him up for them, make him a hero, a rogue, a poet, a jester. Once I pointed out to Lish that the twins might like more details, some fleshing out of the story, maybe an address or a present on their birthday, a postcard. Lish said, &#x201c;Maybe. Maybe not.&#x201d;<br><br>I know that Lish still kept a big silver spoon room service had brought up to the hotel room the night she and the busker got together, and the twins, when they were old enough, took turns using it to scoop the natural chunky peanut butter Lish bought at a health food �co-�op. They&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn to use Dad&#x2019;s spoon.&#x201d; And Lish would smile and hand it over. Who knew what she was thinking. The older girls had a dad they saw fairly regularly and for a while were willing to let the twins use him as theirs, too. But the twins didn&#x2019;t want him. They were happy enough with their �own.<br><br>I should tell you right now how I got to where I am: single mother on the dole, public housing, all that. It wasn&#x2019;t a goal of mine, certainly. As a child I never once dreamed, &#x201c;I will be a poor mother.&#x201d; I had fully intended to be a forest ranger. Now I realize there just isn&#x2019;t enough human contact in that field for me. But then, look where human contact got me. They said I hadn&#x2019;t grieved properly over my mother&#x2019;s death. That was the reason I became promiscuous, they said. They said I snuck out of my bedroom window every night because I needed to forget. I needed to forget, they said, because I couldn&#x2019;t bear the sadness of remembering. That&#x2019;s what they meant by grieving properly: remembering. Remembering everything and reacting to it and releasing it. There was more to it, but I can&#x2019;t remember what it was, ha ha. So I&#x2019;m not proud of it or anything, but it happened. And it&#x2019;s how I got to where I am. �Half-�a-�Life Housing. Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, city with the most hours of sunshine per year (that&#x2019;s another thing they say).<br><br>&#x2013;&#x2013;<br><br>Somewhere along the line I became pregnant. With Dill, my son who is now nine months old. His full name is Dillinger. I don&#x2019;t know who his father is. Like Lish says, if you eat a whole can of beans, how do you know which one made you fart? I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s the caretaker at my dad&#x2019;s church, because Dill&#x2019;s hands are very big. Those huge hands were the first thing I noticed about Dill. The caretaker, on the other hand, had very small hands. I remember, because after we&#x2019;d had sex leaning up against the pulpit, he wandered over to the organ and started playing &#x201c;Midnight Special.&#x201d; I lay on top of the organ, naked as a cherub, and I remember peering down at the caretaker&#x2019;s hands as he played. They were small and cupped and soft like a baby&#x2019;s. So I&#x2019;m quite sure he&#x2019;s not Dill&#x2019;s father. And, to tell you the truth, there were eight or nine other guys I was with at the time Dill was conceived, and most of them have faded from my memory. If I ever did know their names, I&#x2019;ve just about forgotten them. At least I&#x2019;ve tried to. And all this because I didn&#x2019;t grieve �properly.</p><h2>Steel Tiger</h2><p>In 1967 Vietnam, Court Bannister takes on his second tour of duty, Toby Parker struggles against alcohol to earn his wings, and Wolf Lochert degenerates into mercenary madness</p><p>Mark Berent served in the Air Force for more than twenty years, first as an enlisted man and then as an officer and fighter pilot. He has logged over 5,000 hours of flying time, more than 1,000 of them in combat. During his three Vietnam tours, Berent earned not only the Siver Star but also two Distinguished Flying Crosses, twenty-five Air Medals, the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.Berent's (Storm Flight, LJ 9/15/93) latest popular novel is a heroic tale featuring U.S. fighter pilots during the Vietnam War. The text is conveniently spliced with hard rock music and accompanied by sounds of guns and aircraft. The characters have dual conflicts, e.g., Major Court Bannister's brother is a traitor, Captain Toby Parker battles alcoholism, and Lieutenant Colonel Wolf Lochert fights corruption. The vignettes are uneven as is Paul Ikena's narrative performance. Nonetheless, the work will appeal to the action-oriented crowd.

She is a professor of history at Sonoma State University and lives in Petaluma, California.In this revisionist, not entirely credible joint biography of the Londons, Stasz, who teaches at Sonoma University in California, draws on the novelist's writings as clues to his personality, challenging the popular concept of him as a manic, brutal alcoholic, and stressing his sensibility and humane qualities. Charmian, in a portrait based in large part on her diaries, emerges not only as the devoted lover, partner and literary model of a famous man, but as a distinct individual who shared Jack's three years of South Sea Island adventures, the inspiration of the Cruise of the Snark , and published two books of her own. She is shown also as sympathetic to his socialist politics and ranching interests. The author attributes the preoccupation with the spiritual in the novelist's later works to disillusion due to rancor and estrangement from his first wife and daughter, to material losses and to the physical ailments fostered by the alcoholism that led to his death in 1916 at age 39.

Evans looks at the relationship between Milton's epic and the pervasive colonial discourse of Milton's time. Evans bases his analysis on the literature of exploration and colonialism.

Martin Evans, Paradise Lost is at heart a poem about empire. Written during the crucial first phase of English empire-building in the New World, Milton&#39;s epic registers the radically divided attitudes toward the settlement of America that existed in seventeenth-century Protestant England. Evans looks at the relationship between Paradise Lost and the pervasive colonial discourse of Milton&#39;s time. Evans bases his analysis on the literature of exploration and colonialism. The primary sources on which he draws range from sermons about the New World justifying colonization and exhorting virtue among colonists to promotional pamphlets designed to lure people and investment into the colonies. Evans&#39;s research allows him to create a richly textured picture of anxiety and optimism, guilt and moral certitude. The central question is whether Milton supported England&#39;s colonization or covertly attempted to subvert it. In contrast to those who attribute to Paradise Lost a specific political agenda for the American colonies, Evans maintains that Milton reflects the complexity and ambivalence of attitudes held by English society. Analyzing Paradise Lost against this background, Evans offers a new perspective on such fundamental issues as the narrator&#39;s shifting stance in the poem, the unique character of Milton&#39;s prelapsarian paradise, and the moral and intellectual status of Adam and Eve before and after the Fall. From Satan&#39;s arrival in Hell to the expulsion from the garden of Eden, Milton&#39;s version of the Genesis myth resonates with the complex thematics of Renaissance colonialism.<p>J.

The terrorist attacks were seared in the hearts of Americans because we saw them happen in immediate color. But the aftermath of fear, terror, and suspicion could have been worse&#x2014;much worse. And communication made the difference. It was eight months into the presidency of George W. Bush. Mr. Bush was known primarily as a master of mangled syntax who had eked out a win in the narrowest election in history. He ran neck and neck with opponent Al Gore, a notoriously dull, dry speech-maker. As communicators, Gore was no Bill Clinton and Bush was no Ronald Reagan. On the evening of the attacks, President Bush spoke to the American people from the White House. "These acts of mass murder," he said, "were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.... None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world." As important as the words he spoke was his behavior&#x2014;eyes steady, jaw resolute, shoulders firm. This was not the campaigner we had seen months before. This was a leader who was authentic. The speeches President Bush delivered that day gave the American people the sense that this man was ready to lead. Three days later, Friday, September 14, 2001, President Bush went to Washington Cathedral and gave what many consider the most eloquent speech of his presidency. He began in Lincolnesque form with words worthy of the Gettysburg Address. "We are here in the middle hour of our grief," he said. "So many have suffered so great a loss, and today we express our nation&#x2019;s sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead, and for those who loved them." He spoke as the commander in chief, appealing to our resolute strength and unity as Americans. He became America&#x2019;s chaplain, saying, "Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of Life holds all who die and all who mourn." He inspired us with stories, briefly told, to remind us of the heroes of that day: "Inside the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end at the side of his quadriplegic friend. A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter. Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down sixty-eight floors to safety. A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin grafts for burned victims." It was a memorable speech&#x2014;but even more memorable was the speech he gave just a few hours later. He flew to New York and arrived at the sacred ground where the towers had stood. Now dressed in blue jeans and a brown jacket with an open collar, he was greeted by iron-workers and firemen shouting, "U-S-A! U-S-A!" The president walked and shook hands and shouted encouragement. Then he jumped up onto a fire truck with the help of retired fireman Bob Beckwith, who was working at ground zero as an unpaid volunteer. Beckwith was about to climb down, but the president said, "Stay right here," and put his arm around the man. As the chants of "U-S-A!" died down, someone handed a bullhorn to the president. "I want you all to know," Mr. Bush said, "that America today is on bended knee in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, for the workers who work here, for the families who mourn." "I can&#x2019;t hear you!" someone in the crowd shouted. "I can hear you!" the president shouted back through the bullhorn amid applause and cheers. "The rest of the world hears you! And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!" The applause and shouts of "U-S-A! U-S-A!" grew louder, and the president paused until the chanting subsided. "The nation sends its love and compassion to everybody who is here," he concluded. "Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for making the nation proud. And may God bless America." Becoming a President for All What happened? Did the inept communicator get coaching? Did Bush decide to communicate like Clinton? What was the transformation? President George W. Bush became authentic. He was not trying to play the role of president, as he had appeared to before. He was the president. He deeply felt this event and thus he felt his words, and he communicated that feeling. He was real, and authentic, and he had finally reached the First Brain of the American People. In June 2003, Pulitzer prize&#x2013;winning journalist Carl Cannon of the nonpartisan weekly National Journal reflected on what has come to be known as the "Bullhorn Speech." He said, "If we didn&#x2019;t have confidence in him as a communicator, we didn&#x2019;t have confidence in him to do anything. So when Bush does that [the Bullhorn Speech], he really in that moment becomes a President for all the people, and a person that even people who didn&#x2019;t vote for him...can look to as their Commander-in-Chief."1 This is a profound insight: When people have confidence in someone as a communicator, they have confidence in that person, period. The ability to communicate is essential to leadership. It&#x2019;s indispensable to persuasion. It&#x2019;s crucial to the ability to motivate, inspire, energize, galvanize, and mobilize an individual or a nation. The ability to communicate is the key to selling, whether you are selling a product, an idea, a political agenda, or a vision for the future. A Duty to Communicate Regardless of our political views, we can all relate to Mr. Bush in this sense. Few of us are naturally effective at communicating&#x2014;and fewer still enjoy speaking before audiences. But when our circumstances demand greatness, we can rise to the challenge. We can all learn to be more effective communicators. Mr. Bush&#x2019;s approval ratings peaked at 90 percent soon after 9/11, and then began a downward spiral. What accounted for this disastrous slide? For one thing, the war in Iraq was itself under continuous attack, being described in the media as a disaster&#x2014;and Mr. Bush was saying little to counter that portrayal. Then came Hurricane Katrina. Once more the American people had horrors seared into their hearts as they could see the tragedy unfold on live television&#x2014;this time a disaster wreaked by nature instead of man. And this time, where was the leadership? After four days, Mr. Bush strode into an aircraft hangar in Mobile, Alabama, to be briefed on the Katrina response. Greeting FEMA director Michael Brown, he said, "Brownie, you&#x2019;re doing a heck of a job!" To millions of viewers, Mr. Bush seemed shockingly out of touch with reality. The situation cried out for another Bullhorn Speech. The president&#x2019;s response seemed more bull than bullhorn. By April 2006, Mr. Bush&#x2019;s approval ratings hit rock bottom. His presidency appeared to be on life support. Ironically, while his rankings were at an all-time low, the economy was astonishingly strong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was approaching an all-time high. The nation was ringing up record retail sales. Unemployment was below 5 percent. The gross domestic product had grown 4.8 percent in the previous quarter. Minority-owned businesses were experiencing a dramatic upswing. And yet&#x2014; The Simple Secret of Effective Communicating The message for all of us is clear: Whatever our life goals, our career goals, or our dreams of a better world, the key to success lies in our ability to communicate. No matter how uncomfortable or ill-equipped we feel as communicators, we dare not back away from the challenge of becoming effective speakers. Short on skills?

Each of them maintained and promoted the 100 percent raw diet for years. Since then, all three have independently arrived at the same conclusion: that a totally raw diet is not necessarily the best diet. One reason for their shift in thinking is the latest scientific research on the impact of omega essential fatty acids on human health. Studies show that if eaten in excess, omega-6s can cause inflammation and obesity. A typical raw food diet contains large quantities of nuts and seeds, most of which are extremely high in omega-6s and low in omega-3s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raw foodists are not the only ones lacking sufficient omega-3s in their diet. Because omega-3s are easily damaged by heat, anyone whose diet is high in processed foods and oils probably has an omega-3 deficiency. Many symptoms of this deficiency can be mistaken for other health problems or nutrient deficiencies, so few people realize the cause of their ailments.

The career of Traugott von Jassilkowski, an East Prussian of negligible nobility, blindly follows traditional ambitions in 1938, when Nazism has fully permeated German society: nightlife of Weimaresque decadence, marriage to a peroxide Aryan with a munitions fortune and friendship with assorted German aristocrats who have subtly incorporated Nazi ideology into their social customs. The cast of characters runs acoss the social register with animated grotesqueness-especially Mrs. von Schrader, Traugott's mentor and bridge partner. In the form of garrulous gossip to an unseen interlocuter, Rezzori's narration explores with lyric sarcasm his mock hero's trivial rise and pointless inner turmoil. For this dandified Werther, an Oedipal complex is something inflicted like a preemptive punishment along with German romanticism, social blundering and political obtuseness. Compared to his later work, Rezzori's first novel is less profound as satire, its prose often overexuberant and its characters lacking lasting presence, but its indirect animadversions deftly play on postwar denial while sardonically portraying an era in all its aristocratic vainglory. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Daily Chronological Bible: KJV Edition, Trade Paper</h2><p>Stories are basic to life.

By the author of <i>Dancer from the Dance. </i>Tour.</p><p>Lake doesn&#39;t work and doesn&#39;t have friends, a job, or even a first name. All he really has is an abundance of memories of the unsatisfied life of a middle-aged gay man. &#34;I&#39;ve been a flop as a homosexual,&#34; says Lake. The book revolves around Lake&#39;s recollection of a time spent lost and hopeless and takes place in Gainesville, Florida, a place as unspectacular as his existence. In this examination of a life given to thinking about worry and lust, Andrew Holleran raises disturbing questions for people of every sexual preference.Lark, the protagonist of Holleran's profoundly sad, elegant and insightful new novel, his first since Nights in Aruba was published 13 years ago, is virtually unique in today's gay literature: he is a 47-year-old gay man, caring for his quadriplegic mother in a small town in Florida, whose sex life is confined to rest rooms and the baths, who has never come out to his family and whose increasingly empty existence is defined by agonizing loneliness. All the friends from Lark's long-ago glamorous youth in New York are dead of AIDS, and his mother's health has consumed his life as surely as HIV has destroyed the world of Holleran's Dancer from the Dance (1977), one of the classics of gay literature. Age and gray hair have rendered Lark invisible in the sexual competition that defined his life until AIDS, and his mother's impending death has forced him to see that his failure to come out has made him fundamentally invisible to her as well. But Lark, as retrograde and politically incorrect as his life in the closet may make him appear, is nevertheless a chillingly emblematic Everyman, failing to find meaning and purpose in a world devastated by AIDS. Holleran's trademark prose-lush, carefully cadenced and keenly observed-creates a mesmerizingly claustrophobic world where the trapped elderly residents of Lark's mother's nursing home, the lonely men Lark encounters in his fruitless search for love and the overwhelming anonymity of suburban America have equal power to break the heart.

SECOND AIR DIVISION tops out at 464 pages, this second edition featuring 100 pages more than the original, 1994 release. The book opens with a short history of the 2nd AD and the 2nd AD Association, which wrote and compiled the book, followed by a brief history of the Liberator. The first major section of the book is a 42-page history of the Division&#39;s Bomb and Fighter Groups, arranged by the date each was assigned to 2nd AD. Among the Division&#39;s famous B-24 units were the &#34;Flying Eightballs&#34; (44th BG), &#34;Traveling Circus&#34; (93rd BG), the &#34;Crusaders&#34; of the 392nd BG, the &#34;Rackheath Aggies&#34; (467th BG), the &#34;Ringmasters&#34; of the 491st BG and the hard-luck 492nd BG out of North Pickenham. Each BG history consists of a two-six page account of the Group followed by individual reminscences from Group members.</p><p></p><h2>Creating Your Best Life: The Ultimate Life List Guide</h2><p><i>Creating Your Best Life</i> is the only research-based book on the topic of goals and happiness, and it has found receptive audiences worldwide. Filled with interactive exercises and quizzes, it helps readers set and accomplish life list goals and understand the link between goal accomplishment and happiness, also known as Positive Psychology. In a step-by-step fashion, the book teaches readers how to coach themselves on how to set goals in 16 life domains, as well as take control of their environment to maximize their chances of success.&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline Adams Miller, MAPP, an internationally known coach and speaker on the topics of goals, grit and positive psychology appears regularly on television and in newspapers and magazines. She is a regular &#34;happiness&#34; expert in the media, as well as an instructor at the Wharton Business School for Executive Education. For 20 years, Dr. Michael B. Frisch is a clinical psychologist in Baylor University&#39;s department of psychology and neuroscience, and contributed the &#34;Happiness House&#34; exercise to the book.Starred Review. Life coach Miller collaborates with Frisch, a researcher and clinical psychologist, to create a fascinating book that connects the research on goal-setting with the new science of positive psychology. Turns out these two have a symbiotic relationship, for as Miller says, [H]appiness requires having clear-cut goals in life that give us a sense of purpose and direction.... when we make progress toward attaining goals in one area of life, we raise our overall life satisfaction in other areas because of the 'spillover' effect. Each chapter focuses on ways to increase happiness and self-efficacy, and directs readers to a particular life list at the back of the book. These range from 100 Things to Do Before I Die to a list of mood-boosters that bring Jolts of Joy or a Web of Influence Map, where readers can chart how the closest people in their lives reflect their values; research indicates that rates of obesity and smoking are determined by who we socialize with. The authors share ingenious tips on reminders (cellphone ring tones, screen savers) that will help readers achieve long-term goals by suggestion. An excellent resource list rounds out the book. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its stability and very existence were challenged repeatedly by the tension between the pressures for overarching political cohesion and the defense of separate national identities and aspirations.</p><p>In a brilliant analysis of this complex and sensitive national question, Ivo Banac provides a comprehensive introduction to Yugoslav political history. His book is a genetic study of the ideas, circumstances, and events that shaped the pattern of relations among the nationalities of Yugoslavia. It traces and analyzes the history and characteristics of South Slavic national ideologies, connects these trends with Yugoslavia's flawed unification in 1918, and ends with the fatal adoption of the centralist system in 1921.</p><p>Banac focuses on the first two and a half years in the history of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, because in his view this was the period that set the pattern for subsequent development of the national question. The issues that divided the South Slavs, and that still divide them today, took on definite form during that time, he maintains.</p><p>Banac provides extensive treatment of all of Yugoslavia's nationalities; his sections on the Montenegrins, Albanians, Macedonians, and Bosnian Muslims are unique in the literature. In this unbiased account, all of the principals and groups assume a tragic fascination.</p><p>When published in 1984, <i>The National Question in Yugoslavia</i> was the first complete introduction to the cultural history of the South Slavic peoples and to the politics of Yugoslavia, and it remains a major contribution to the scholarship on modern European nationalism and the stability of multinational states.</p></p><p><p>Ivo Banac is Professor of History and Master of Pierson College, Yale University.</p><p>"Ivo Banac has written the most comprehensive, judicious, and objective account of the origins, development, and politics of the Yugoslav national question up to the aftermath of World War I that exists in any language. What especially enhances the value of this account is not only the author's thorough grasp of the political intricacies of his subject but his erudite command of the cultural factors."</p> (Michael B. Petrovich <i>Slavic Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Anyone interested in contemporary Yugoslavia must read this excellent volume because no other book in any language sets forth the issues in such stark and realistic terms. Unlike many other books on the South Slav nationality problem, which analyze it more from the perspective of the Serbs, Banac seeks to restore the balance by looking at the problems through the eyes of the other South Slavs, in particular the Croats, and this is the great strength of the volume. Banac's outstanding book tells the story with great clarity and deep understanding and appreciation for South Slavic affairs."</p> (Charles Jelavich <i>Journal of Modern History</i>)<br><br><p>"Ivo Banac's study of the origins of the national question in Yugoslavia provides the substantive content necessary to return to Yugoslav experience and to identify the national differences that are being 'accommodated' by current political reform. It is also an excellent starting point for those who want to study actual cultures of rule in contemporary Yugoslavia."</p> (Susan L. Woodward <i>World Politics</i>)<br><br><p>"An indispensable book on Yugoslavia and one of the most impressive works on Eastern Europe for decades."</p> (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br><p>"The greatest strength of Banac's book is the thoroughness and accuracy with which he recounts the historical background, personal factors, and ideological structures within which Yugoslav politicians worked. Along with its other virtues, the book is a pleasure to read. Banac has flair. In scope, detail, and presentation, this book finds few equals in the literature of Southeast Europe. It is simply one of the finest studies of the region that Western scholarship has produced."</p> (Gale Stokes <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Banac's history of the peoples of Yugoslavia is comprehensive, detached, and well timed. Banac begins his inquiry with an examination of the terminology of nation, nationhood, and nationality, which then proceeds to apply to the South Slavs, drawing a distinction between the national identity of the Serbs, Croats, and Bulgars, which was acquired before the development of modern nationalism, and that of the Slovenes, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Muslims from Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose national consciousness developed only in the nineteenth century."</p> (Patrick F. R. Artisien <i>International Affairs</i>)</p><h2>Feeding The Eye: Essays</h2><p>A new book on the nourishing powers of visual art-film, painting, dance, and clothes.<br><br>Since the advent of cinema more than a hundred years ago, visual art has tended to be perceived as if it were in motion, and as the century ends, we notice that artists create less often in fresco or carved stone and more on film or tape, on the dance stage or in the ever changing, ever moving medium of clothes. In this remarkable collection of writing that ranges over art of the past century with unusual depth of historical insight, the noted critic Anne Hollander explores these rich, diverse visual treasures and the underlying themes that connect them.<br><br><i>Feeding the Eye</i> opens with a wonderful array of "modern legends"-essays on celebrated figures from Balanchine to Cartier-Bresson, from Kafka to Chanel, from Isadora Duncan to Simone de Beauvoir-who have helped to define our world. Other sections of the book are devoted to the arts of dressing or decorating the human body-Hollander is particularly celebrated for her bold and original interpretations of this theme-and to classic, often misinterpreted artists of the cinema: Chaplin and Garbo, among others. Hollander concludes by asking us to consider how great paintings of the past continue, in many different ways and contexts, to startle us with "the tonic effect of acute optical experience, which is the whole world's natural birthright."<br></p><p>"Over the past two decades, the art historian Anne Hollander has made a unique contribution to American letters with her bold studies of the evolution of costume and of its relationship to the other arts. . . . Most of the pieces in <i>Feeding the Eye</i> range far beyond the immediate scope of the works they originally chronicled, and the author's erudition and style give the collection a luminous unity."

Fueled by John D. Rockefeller&#x2019;s vast petroleum fortune, the entire family&#x2019;s terrific passion for the arts transformed the artistic infrastructure of twentieth century America. Funding museums like the MoMA, the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of the Oriental Art at the University of Chicago, and commissioning major architectural projects like Rockefeller Center, Riverside Church, and Lincoln Center, the Rockefellers&#x2019; achievements forever changed the cultural landscape of the Western world. Loebl&#x2019;s penetrating biography is the first book to deeply explore the family&#x2019;s critical role as collectors and patrons of the arts.</p><p><blockquote><p>The first book to explore the immense cultural contributions of one of America's wealthiest and most influential families: the Rockefellers.</p></blockquote><p>Abby Aldrich Rockefeller sparked her family's passion for art, but it was her husband, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who once was hailed as the "greatest friend and patron of the arts since Florence's Lorenzo de Medici." Together and separately they, as well as their descendents, became a major force on the American art scene. The dozen Rockefeller-sponsored museums, including MoMA and the Cloisters, are among the world's finest. Their architectural projects&#x2014;Rockefeller Center, the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, Lincoln Center&#x2014;are equally stellar. The family also enriched existing institutions with entire collections of modern, Asian, "primitive," and folk art, in addition to ancient artifacts.</p><p>Based on a wealth of information culled from the family's extensive archives, <em>America's Medicis</em> traces the Rockefellers' artistic philanthropies from their beginnings to the present. As author Suzanne Loebl makes clear, the Rockefellers did more than simply provide money and artworks; they also devoted themselves to the causes they believed in&#x2014;a commitment that helped define and direct America's artistic tastes. In spite of all these material gifts, the Rockefellers' most lasting contribution was to teach America that art does not belong to a rarefied elite, but can be enjoyed and understood by all. Erudite and engaging, <em>America's Medicis</em> is a remarkable account of the twentieth-century American art world and the extraordinary family at its center.</p><p>Suzanne Loebl is a writer living in New York and Maine. She is the author of fourteen books, most recently <em>America&#x2019;s Art Museums</em>. </p></p><h2>Ghazals of Ghalib</h2><p>New! Compare this edition with six others at http://www.bandannabooks.com/vsghalib.php. Ghalib, a court poet in India during the period of British takeover, excelled in poetry both in Urdu and Persian. Ghazals are a poetry genre with couplets gathered that share a common theme but do not form a narrative sequence. With these two-liners, Ghalib was a master. His subjects range from personal to cosmic, and includes his metaphoric &#34;love affair&#34; with God, in which he protests the neglect or spurning by The Beloved. Ghalib lived by his wits, with cleverness and astuteness. He did not regard himself as a mystic, yet he marvels at the wonders of existence. Ghalib&#39;s work gives a sense of the state of India as it came under the British. He himself was not political; Gandhi came to represent that dimension of Indian philosophy with satyagraha. Gandhi&#39;s best thought might be seen in Gandhi on the Gita (Bhagavad Gita) (www.createspace.com/4035181).</p><p>Ghalib (Mirza Asadullah Khan) was born in 1797 with Seljuk Turk ancestry. His father and uncle led mercenary troops for various Indian rajahs, but both died by the time Ghalib was nine years old. By assiduous work, he eventually became a respected court poet. He lived through the Sepoy Mutiny of four months, later writing about it, as the British regained control of India. He claimed to be free from the bonds of convention and every religion. He died at age 73.Text: English</p><h2>The History of Hair: Fashion and Fantasy Down the Ages</h2><p>Hair, and its association with art and fashion, has until now been a sadly neglected subject.

Get in on the fun with this guide to putting together that very first altered book, and beyond. The entire enjoyable process receives attention, from choosing a theme to the mechanics involved to the variety of crafting techniques to use. Hundreds of sample pages will inspire you to start immediately.</p><p>Matthiessen&#x2014;a crafter, designer and author&#x2014;isn't suggesting anything untoward when she speaks of altering books. Rather, she advocates recycling and reusing old books (and the elements crafters can use to decorate them) in the pursuit of creativity, self-expression and enjoyment. Wannabe artists uncertain of their qualifications can relax: "You do not need to be able to draw, paint, or even cut a straight line to alter a book." The art form, also known as "palimpsest," dates back to the 11th century and draws largely on traditional collage techniques. The book offers plenty of large, colorful photos that take readers step-by-step through priming and sealing a page, or perhaps embellishing a domino or glass microscope slide; lists of recommended supplies and tools aid in preparation. A gallery of creations comprises the second half of the book, and a chapter entitled "101 Ways to Alter a Book" provides further inspiration. Avid scrapbookers should have a smooth transition to this crafting arena, as will those who already have a collection of found objects and curios at the ready. Generally speaking, the artwork in the book has a shabby chic sensibility, though punk crafters could easily substitute tiny skull-and-crossbones for butterflies and fishnet for lace. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The disaster terrified its survivors, shocked that a civilization that had blandly assumed itself to be a model for the rest of the world had collapsed into a chaotic savagery beyond any comparison. In 1939 Europeans would initiate a second conflict that managed to be even worse - a war in which the killing of civilians was central and which culminated in the Holocaust. To Hell and Back tells this story with humanity, flair and originality. Kershaw gives a compelling narrative of events, but he also wrestles with the most difficult issues that the events raise - with what it meant for the Europeans who initiated and lived through such fearful times - and what this means for us.</p><p>Ian Kershaw is the author of Hitler, Fateful Choices and The End.Few authors would have the ability, and perhaps the determination, to take on the history of both world wars and the connecting decades at this level of sophistication, depth and breadth -- Robert Tombs * The Times * It is true that his subject could hardly be more familiar, but it is a great achievement to cover such vast historical territory in under 600 pages and with such scrupulous balance, care and good sense. Other historians&#39; books on the same period may be flashier or more provocative. But to read Kershaw on Europe&#39;s bloody century is to be driven through a ravaged landscape in the sleek, smooth comfort of a Rolls-Royce, guided by a historian who probably knows the territory better than anybody else on the planet -- Dominic Sandbrook * The Sunday Times * Ian Kershaw is the historian that other academic historians most admire ... Prof Kershaw sits at the very top of his profession. He is one of a tiny handful of historians whose books will still be read in 100 years. So he takes a big risk by moving out of his area of expertise in order to write an all-encompassing history of Europe in the 20th century. His courage has paid off. To Hell and Back, the first of two volumes on the subject, is a triumph -- Laurence Rees * The Mail on Sunday * A triumph -- Lawrence Rees * Mail on Sunday * Kershaw leads his readers through this complex history in a clear and compelling manner -- Joanna Bourke * Prospect * To Hell and Back should be required reading in every chancellery, every editorial cockpit and every place where peevish Euroskeptics do their thinking -- Harold Evans * The New York Times * Authoritative -- Nicholas Shakespeare * Telegraph *</p><h2>Huck Scarry&#39;s Steam Train Journey</h2><p>Detailed pictures with captions and brief text present factual information about steam trains and their history.</p><p></p><h2>Revelation: The Birth of a New Age</h2><p>Former owner&#39;s inscription on back of front cover.

To the north, the history of Gorhaut has been forged with blood and fire, and now a degenerate king and his ruthless advisor seek to quench a thirst for conquest by sweeping down upon Arbonne. But the land of courtly love is also a land of passion, willing to wage a complex and cunning fight to survive.</p> <p>Inspired by the glorious world of the troubadours, <i>A Song for Arbonne</i> is Guy Gavriel Kay's love song to medieval Provence.</p></p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is an international bestselling author.

As in Tigana , it is a world with two moons. The matriarchal, cultured land of Arbonne is rent by a feud between its two most powerful dukes, the noble troubador Bertran de Talair and Urte de Miraval, over long-dead Aelis, lover of one, wife of the other and once heir to the country's throne. To the north lies militaristic Gorhaut, whose inhabitants worship the militant god Corannos and are ruled by corrupt, womanizing King Ademar. His chief advisor, the high priest of Corannos, is bent on wiping out the worship of a female deity, whose followers live to the south. Into this cauldron of brewing disaster comes the mysterious Gorhaut mercenary Blaise, who takes service with Bertran and averts an attempt on his life. The revelation of Blaise's lineage and a claim for sanctuary by his sister-in-law set the stage for a brutal clash between the two cultures. Intertwined is the tale of a young woman troubadour whose role suggests the sweep of the drama to come. Kay creates a vivid world of love and music, magic and death in a realm that resembles ours but is just different enough to enrich the fantasy genre. 25,000 first printing; major ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Walk With Jesus: Stations of the Cross</h2><p>Thirteen moving meditations and four-color illustrations by Sr. Helen David which combine reflection on the passion of Christ, the suffering of the poor, and the appropriate Christian response.</p><p>For more information about the life and works of Henri J.M.

Illustrated.</p><p>Foodies are by now more than familiar with recipe books that double as memoirs, but this one stakes out new territory: that of the biographical cookbook. Araldo (1896-1989) came of age at a time when the cooking of Brittany was just winning high regard among Parisians; a student of Henri-Paul Pellaprat, she was one of the first women to earn a toque from the Cordon Bleu. For most of her life, she worked as a chef in the homes of the wealthy, which may have given her the autonomy she needed to preserve and further her own family's Breton tastes, detailed here by Reynolds, first a student of Araldo's and later a close friend. Characterized by unusual combinations and a passionate hatred of waste, Araldo's recipes use almost every part of every vegetable. Pairings of wild blueberries with red cabbage, beet custards with black currants, and Jerusalem artichokes with bananas may sound outlandish--but the tongue will confirm the correctness of the match, enforced by the tart instructions of the formidable cook herself.

This lovely book, put together by a chef with whom she worked, contains her vegetable recipes for simple dishes in the Breton tradition, more elegant classically based French dishes, and the innovative creations developed for Reynolds's restaurant.

Johnson gathers many rare early narratives detailing the participants' trying experiences into one of the most accurate accounts to date of this disastrous event.</p></p><p>"Unfortunate Emigrants": Narratives Of The Donner Party is a selection of rare and hard-to-find early accounts of the 1846 emigrant party that was trapped in the winter snows of the Sierra Nevada, recounting their strenuous and conflict-ridden trail west; their experiences of starvation, death, and cannibalism; and the herculean but disorganized efforts of Californians to rescue the survivors. Reading this compendium of original, descriptive accounts is compelling, engaging and unforgettable. No Western American frontier history collection can be considered complete without this astonishing book. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>7,000 Hudson-Mohawk Valley (NY) Vital Records, 1808-1850</h2><p>In the towns and cities of New York, prior to 1880, official records of marriage and death were rarely filed. Fortunately, newspapers can often be used to overcome this deficiency, as they contain a wealth of information about the marriages and deaths of local people. Moreover, newspaper notices of marriages and deaths often contain detail lacking in the more frequently sought cemetery, church, and town record books. The compilers of this new book have joined forces to produce a list of 7,000 marriages and deaths--naming 20,000 persons in all--from fifteen newspapers of the Hudson-Mohawk Valley area, giving researchers a much-needed boost in their search for vital records. <p> Typically the marriage notices give such information as the names of the bride and groom, the date of the marriage, the place, the names of parents, and the name of the officiating minister. Death notices, on the other hand, provide the date and place of death, age at death, sometimes cause of death, occupation, and names of survivors.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Forbidden Door</h2><p>Although her people have been forced to live underground for many years by the evil Okira, Reena discovers the forbidden door to the outside world and manages to free them.</p><p>Grade 3-4 Reena and her parents, the last of their kind, live safely in an underground cave filled with wondrous treasures. One day during her explorations, Reena comes to an ancient tapestry which hides a door that leads to the dangerous outside. A hideous monster named the Okira traps her in vines. Little winged creatures help rescue her and help her steal the Ruby Crystal, the source of the Okira's power. Finally Reena and her parents can emerge from their cave. The bland text lacks vivid language and precise descriptions of setting and characters. For example, the Okira, a major character, is solely described as "a creature of the most horrible proportions, with eyes full of evil." The book also lacks drama and tension. Although Reena is held captive, what her horrible fate is to be is never defined. And finally it lacks cohesiveness and imagination. The ending is standard: the Okira is captured, and Reena and her family live happily ever after. All that is missing in the text can be found in the illustrations. Beautifully rendered in a fantasy/surrealistic style, they are filled with fascinating creatures and intricate settings, all fully conceived and strongly colored. Heyer relies on her splendid illustrations not only to expand the text, but also literally to tell the story, and they are not enough to save this original fantasy story. Karen K. Radtke, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.On the smallest star in the sky, in the Valley of the Bao-Bickle tree, live Reena and her parents, who have always resided in a cave. When her mother tells her fabulous stories about a forbidden place called Outside and a golden orb known as Sun, Reena knows she must find the door leading there. Once Outside, however, Reena meets the terrible Okira, a monster who gets her power from beautiful thingsor beautiful people. Reena is a liberatorlike Esther or Joan of Arcbut despite its classic theme, the tale suffers from melodramatic writing and unclear movement. Heyer's elaborately detailed illustrations of fantastic creatures give a baroque feeling; her ogres are wonderful. The intricate details add to the story's dreamlike quality, but cannot compensate for the flaws of the sentimental and wordy narrative.

Swiss tells the heartbreaking, horrifying, and ultimately triumphant story of the women exiled from the British Isles and forced into slavery and savagery-who created the most liberated society of their time. </b> <br><br> Agnes McMillan and Janet Houston were convicted for shoplifting. Bridget Mulligan stole a bucket of milk; Widow Ludlow Tedder, eleven spoons. For their crimes, they would be sent not to jail, but to ships teeming with other female convicts. Tin tickets, stamped with numbers, were hung around the women's necks, and the ships set out to carry them to their new home: Van Diemen's Land, later known as Tasmania, part of the British Empire's crown jewel, Australia. Men outnumbered women nine to one there, and few "proper" citizens were interested in emigrating. The deportation of thousands of petty criminals-the vast majority nonviolent first offenders-provided a convenient solution for the government. <br><br> Crossing Shark-infested waters, some died in shipwrecks during the four-month journey, or succumbed to infections and were sent to a watery grave. Others were impregnated against their will by their captors. They arrived as nothing more than property. But incredibly, as the years passed, they managed not only to endure their privation and pain but to thrive on their own terms, breaking the chains of bondage, and forging a society that treated women as equals and led the world in women's rights. <br><br> <i>The Tin Ticket</i> takes us to the dawn of the nineteenth century and into the lives of Agnes McMillan, whose defiance and resilience carried her to a far more dramatic rebellion; Agnes's best friend Janet Houston, who rescued her from the Glasgow wynds and was also transported to Van Diemen's Land; Ludlow Tedder, forced to choose just one of her four children to accompany her to the other side of the world; Bridget Mulligan, who gave birth to a line of powerful women stretching to the present day. It also tells the tale of Elizabeth Gurney Fry, a Quaker reformer who touched all their lives. Ultimately, it is the story of women discarded by their homeland and forgotten by history-who, by sheer force of will, become the heart and soul of a new nation.</p><p><b>Deborah J. Swiss</b> received her Ed.D. from Harvard University, and is the author of <i>Women and the Work/ Family Dilemma, Women Breaking Through</i>, and <i>The Male Mind at Work</i>. She lives in Lexington, Massachusetts."The Irish feature in disproportionate numbers among the convicts transported to Australia. The number of female Irish convicts rose considerably in the aftermath of the great Irish Famine, a period which also saw the transportation of more than 4,000 Irish orphans girls as "breeding stock" for the new colony. Deborah Swiss brings new light and insight into the story of female convicts transported to Australia and in telling this story through the lives of a number of individual women brings home to us both the tragedy and the triumph of these resilient women." <br> -M�irtfn + Fainfn, Ambassador of Ireland <br><br> "Deborah Swiss eloquently and engagingly uncovers a buried and important piece of Australian "herstory," convicted women who endured injustice, cruelty, and hardship. Even more than that, Swiss skillfully illuminates their essence in their extraordinary resilience, determination, and courage. An inspiration to all." <br><br> -Birute Regine, author of <i>Iron Butterflies: Women Transforming Themselves and the World.</i> <br><br> "<i>The Tin Ticket</i> powerfully illustrates the unimaginable vulnerability and desperation that came with being poor and female two hundred years ago in Britain. But the stories of the women in this book are not too different from those of the millions who are trafficked across continents even today for cheap labor or sex. And like these women, the founding mothers of Australia exemplify the same remarkable resilience and resourcefulness that women show to pull themselves and their families out of adversity. <i>The Tin Ticket</i> tells their story, and enriches our shared history as women and as human beings." <br> -Ritu Sharma, Co-Founder and President, Women Thrive Worldwide <br><br> "History books far too often scant the stories of women, of the poor, and of those swallowed up in the prison system. Deborah Swiss has broken this triple barrier to bring us a moving and fascinating story -- both of forgotten people who were ruthlessly exploited, and of a remarkable woman who did much to help them." <br> -Adam Hochschild, author of <i>King Leopold's Ghost</i> and <i>Bury the Chains</i>, co-founder of <i>Mother Jones</i>.</p><h2>Cardozo</h2><p><p> Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, unarguably one of the most outstanding judges of the twentieth century, is a man whose name remains prominent and whose contributions to the law remain relevant. This first complete biography of the longtime member and chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals and Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States during the turbulent years of the New Deal is a monumental achievement by a distinguished interpreter of constitutional law. </p><p> </p><p> Cardozo was a progressive judge who understood and defended the proposition that judge-made law must be adapted to modern conditions. He also preached and practiced the doctrine that respect for precedent, history, and all branches of government limited what a judge could and should do. Thus, he did not modernize law at every opportunity. </p><p> </p><p> In this book, Kaufman interweaves the personal and professional lives of this remarkable man to yield a multidimensional whole. Cardozo's family ties to the Jewish community were a particularly significant factor in shaping his life, as was his father's scandalous career--and ultimate disgrace--as a lawyer and judge. Kaufman concentrates, however, on Cardozo's own distinguished career, including twenty-three years in private practice as a tough-minded and skillful lawyer and his classic lectures and writings on the judicial process. From this biography emerges an estimable figure holding to concepts of duty and responsibility, but a person not without frailties and prejudice. </p></p><p>Andrew L. Kaufman has, after 40 years of work, written what will be the definitive biography of Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Cardozo was one of the premier judges of the first half of this century, serving on the New York Court of Appeals as Chief Judge, the most influential state court in the country, and then on the Supreme Court. On the New York Court of Appeals, Cardozo rewrote tort law with his stamp; his characterizations of negligence, proximate cause, and assumption of the risk still dominate law throughout the land 60 to 80 years after his original decisions.<p> Kaufman recounts all of this, effectively combining legal analysis with biography. Cardozo's father was a judge tarnished with scandal, and it has long been theorized that Cardozo's life was an attempt to retrieve that lost honor. He would, for example, turn down even the simplest gifts that other judges routinely accepted. Kaufman arguably overplays the honor theme when it comes to his legal analysis, most notably in his analysis of <i>Meinhard</i> v. <i>Salmon</i>, in which the judge declared that, in matters of fiduciary obligations, "[a] trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the marketplace." Kaufman, perhaps stretching Cardozo's opinion too far to reach the desired conclusion, views this decision as "a culmination of Cardozo's efforts to implant a sense of honorable conduct into law."</p><p> The only potential downside to the book, other than the occasional desire to see Kaufman address more frequently the thoughts and analysis of other biographers and commentators on Cardozo's life and work, is that Cardozo's virtue risks becoming the biography's failing: his life <i>was</i> his work. He was celibately monkish in his private life, and other than the politicking behind each of his successive appointments to higher courts, Cardozo's political life was for the most part equally quiet. Fortunately, Cardozo's legal output is so varied and important that the biography's necessary focus on his judicial career is not wasted effort for the author or the reader. <i>--Ted Frank</i></p>Andrew L.

She is the mother of two grown daughters, Victoria and Marguerite, and grandmother to four girls.</p>Three well-honed first-person narratives add up to an outstanding biography of one remarkable woman: Mary Breckinridge, founder of the still-extant Frontier Nursing Service in the Appalachian Mountains. After being widowed twice and having lost two children, Breckenridge enrolled in nursing school, determined to help other youngsters live. Wells takes up Breckenridge's story upon her arrival in 1923 Kentucky, through the perspectives of three people whose lives were greatly affected by her mission. John Hawkins, the young son of a "river man" injured while riding newly cut logs down the rapids, tells how Mary fortuitously arrived at their doorstep before the "horse doctor with a bone saw" came to saw his father's leg off. An 18-year-old nurse who travels from her native Scotland to work with Mary describes her battle to convince the mountain residents (who are terrified of needles) to let the nurses vaccinate them against rampant diphtheria. In the finalAand most stirringAof the accounts, Pearl refuses to talk after witnessing her mother's death from childbirth. Through drafting the girl into her cause, Mary moves Pearl to speak again. Wells's careful attention to the details and hardships of mountain living authenticates these achingly real accounts, as she spells out both the enormity of Breckenridge's challenge and the triumph of even the smallest victories.

By the author of <i>Kill Devil Hill. </i></p><p><b>Harry Combs</b> (1913-2003) was the author of the acclaimed novel <i>Brules</i>. An aviation pioneer and executive whose flying career began in 1928, his interest in early flight led him to research and write <i>Kill Devil Hill,</i> an award-winning study of the Wright brothers. He also received the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, the aviation industry&#x2019;s most coveted and prestigious award for public service.Impressive scope and vivid detail don't redeem this violent and misanthropic novel of a killer's journey across the Old West, by the author of Kill Devil Hill (1979). On a Colorado ranch in 1916, the elderly Cat Brules tells his story to a college-age listener. He begins in Hays City, Kans., where in 1867 he has just quit his job and plans to rob a Texas bank with his old friend Pedro. Brules has a night of wild sex with a prostitute named Michelle; returning to her room on the following night, he finds his former boss beating the woman. Brules kills him and must flee Hays City with Michelle. After traveling several days with little food or water, they cross paths with Pedro and decide to follow his trail markings southward. Comanches soon capture Brules and Michelle, torturing him and roasting her alive. Brules shoots his way out of the camp, only to find Pedro's remains further down the trail. He begins an Indian-killing spree to avenge his two friends' deaths, but after a Shoshone woman named Wild Rose nurses him back to health following a grizzly bear attack, his opinion of Native Americans changes. Brules and Wild Rose marry, have a daughter, and build a cabin. After a horse tramples his wife to death, Brules gives their child to the care of the Shoshone and lives the rest of his life in solitude. Many unnecessary digressions make this novel far too long. Its violence, moreover, is off-putting: Combs clearly intends Brules's hatred of Indians to reflect Old West attitudes, but the fugitive's racism becomes grating over the course of 500 pages; the 100 pages of domestic bliss following his marriage to Wild Rose cannot change the protagonist's brutal image. The bloodshed and bravado may thrill some shoot-'em-up enthusiasts, but this story is as flat as the western desert. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Why did a top White House official decide to come clean and accept a prison sentence during Watergate? Why did a finance executive turn down millions out of respect for her employer? Why are some willing to risk their futures to uphold principles? What gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe?</p><p>As these questions suggest, the topic of moral courage is front and center in today's culture. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the U.S. Olympic Committee, abusive priests, cheating students, domestic violence -- all these remind us that taking ethical stands should be a higher priority in our culture. Why, when people discern wrongdoing, are they sometimes unready, unable, or unwilling to act?</p><p>In a book rich with examples, Rushworth Kidder reveals that moral courage is the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics. Defining it as a readiness to endure danger for the sake of principle, he explains that the courage to act is found at the intersection of three elements: action based on core values, awareness of the risks, and a willingness to endure necessary hardship. By exploring how moral courage spurs us to strive for core values, he demonstrates the benefits of ethical action to the individual and to society -- and the severe consequences that can result from remaining morally dormant.</p><p><strong>Moral Courage</strong> puts indispensable concepts and tools into our hands, equipping us to respond to the increasingly complicated moral challenges we face at work, at home, and in our communities. It enables us to make clear, confident decisions by exploring some litmus-test questions:</p><ul><li>Is the benefit worth the risk?</li><li>Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others?</li><li>Will my actions create collateral damage among those with no stake in the outcome?</li> </ul><p>While physical courage may no longer be a necessary survival skill or an essential rite of passage out of childhood, few would dispute the growing need for moral courage as the true gauge of maturity. Treating this subject not as an esoteric branch of philosophy but as a practical necessity for modern life, Kidder deftly leads us to a clear understanding of what moral courage is, what it does, and how to get it.</p></p><p><p>Rushworth M. Kidder was a professor of English at Wichita State University for ten years before becoming an award-winning columnist and editor at the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>. The author of ten books on subjects ranging from international ethics to the global future, he won the 1980 Explicator Literary Foundation Award for his book on the poetry of E.E. cummings. He and his wife, Elizabeth, live in Lincolnville, Maine.</p>Defining moral courage as "the quality of mind and spirit that enables one to face up to ethical challenges firmly and confidently," Kidder, president of the Institute for Global Ethics, offers a treatise on the "courage to be moral" replete with examples and analysis. He offers a step-by-step guide, including checklists, on how to apply moral values to difficult situations, understand risks (more often career troubles and social ostracism than physical harm) and endure hardships brought on by moral courage itself. He explores how and why people can fail to be morally courageous, and ways that they can learn to behave better, offering anecdotes that range from an investment firm employee choosing to confess a potentially costly mistake to a married couple refusing to let unmarried guests sleep together, despite prevailing cultural norms. The book is weaker on the philosophical side. An extended distinction drawn between physical and moral courage ends up muddy and sometimes patronizing toward those whose courage entails only physical risk; it appears almost as if moral courage were a white-collar courage and physical courage a less exalted blue-collar sort. The analysis of how moral action and values interlock is never thoroughly convincing, since the former seems to cover almost anyone who claims to stand on principle (such as the boss who cut his workers' wages by $3 an hour), but there is enough thoughtfulness here for a substantive introduction to a worthwhile subject. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet tech secrets lie hidden, useful to those brave and strong enough to believe that hope can carry them toward ever-elusive peace.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>BAD TO THE BONE&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Violent gangs, a corrupt mayor and a heavily armed police force are the hallmarks of former Detroit, a mutie-infested, rubble-strewn metropolis. When Ryan and the companions show up, the Desolation Angels are waging a war to rule the streets. After saving the companions from being chilled by gangsters, the mayor hires Ryan and his friends to stop the Angels cold. But each hard blow toward victory proves there's no good side to be fighting for. As Motor City erupts into bloody conflagration, the companions are caught in the crossfire. In Deathlands, hell is called home.</p><p>"Ryan! Wake up! We've got a problem!"<br><br>Mildred Wyeth's urgent voice cut through the dreadful jump disorientation and summoned Ryan Cawdor's soul back to his pain-racked body. His stomach felt as if it had been wrenched inside out.<br><br>Bad one, he thought. Been through worse.<br><br>When he opened his eye, he was already being helped up by a firm, dry grip on his forearm. That would be J. B. Dix, Ryan's chief lieutenant, best friend and the armorer of the small group of companions who traveled the Deathlands.<br><br>"Tell me something new," Ryan said, slurring his words. He swayed as he got to his feet and was steadied by J.B. "Is everyone else awake?"<br><br>J.B. didn't have time to answer the question.<br><br>"Muties!" Ricky Morales screamed. There was no mistaking the hideous shapes visible through the opaque ar-maglass walls of the mat-trans unit.<br><br>Ryan was back in command of his body, and he slammed the heel of his hand on the big red button by the keypad that controlled the workings of the gateway. The LD button was a fail-safe designed to transfer the companions back to their last destination.<br><br>No one had a desire to return to what remained of the ville of Progress, but that was the least of their worries.<br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>"So we're stuck here," Mildred said after several moments.<br><br>The stocky black woman, her hair in beaded plaits, didn't even flinch as a face pressed itself against the glass, becoming nearly visible through the opaque wall. Its nose was two holes above a wide-open mouth full of jagged teeth. Its eyes, though unnaturally round, were disconcertingly humanlike. Enough to show an almost intolerable rage.<br><br>"Ryan," Krysty Worth called. The statuesque beauty was staring at the base of the armaglass walls. Her sentient red hair was still coiled tightly to her scalp, as it tended to do in times of severe stress. "Water's building up in here."<br><br>"Great," Mildred moaned. "Isn't this a bit coincidental? I mean muties, yeah. Muties are everywhere. But we jump in here and the place decides to flood right now?"<br><br>"With the chamber door closed securely, that should be nearly impossible," said a tall, silver-haired man. He shot the cuffs of the dingy white shirt he wore beneath his black frock coat with an elegance that belied the shabbiness of the garment. Doc Tanner knew a little about the workings of the network&#x2014;and the white coats who built them&#x2014;because they'd trawled him out of his own time in the 1890s to use and abuse as a subject for their experiments in time. And when Doc proved to be a most unwilling subject, he was sent into the future to what was now the Deathlands. Their experiments had prematurely aged him. Although he appeared to be a man in his late sixties, Doc was really in his thirties.<br><br>Ryan drew his SIG Sauer P226 handblaster with his right hand and his panga with his left.<br><br>"Get ready to blast out of here," he said. "J.B., you do the honors."<br><br>The one-eyed man took in his little group with a sweeping glance. Krysty stood resolutely at his right shoulder, gripping her Smith &amp; Wesson snub-nosed .38 revolver in both hands. Mildred stood just behind her, holding her more substantial .38 ZKR target revolver at the ready. Doc had drawn both his LeMat replica handgun, with the stubby shotgun barrel beneath its immense cylinder holding nine rounds of .44 Special, and the blade concealed in his ebony sword stick with the silver lion's head. Ricky held his Webley top-break .45 revolver.<br><br>Ryan stood right behind J.B.'s left shoulder. The Armorer had his Uzi slung muzzle down over his shoulder and his Smith &amp; Wesson M4000 riot shotgun held level. Jak Lauren stood at J.B.'s right.<br><br>"Ready?" Ryan asked. More muties seemed to be crowding into the anteroom.<br><br>"Ready as we're going to be," Mildred said. The others voiced their agreement.<br><br>"Hit it," Ryan told J.B.<br><br>He maneuvered the lever that opened the door, and water swirled in, almost to the tops of Ryan's boots. With it came stink of sewage so thick the one-eyed man almost choked.<br><br>J.B. was already striding forward through the anteroom with his scattergun held level. The mutie that had pressed its hideous face against the armaglass swung a black-taloned hand at the Armorer.<br><br>He blasted it in the belly with a charge of #4 buckshot. The weapon's report almost imploded Ryan's eardrums in the walled confines of the jump chamber. The mutie vented a high-pitched squeal and doubled over, clutching its ruptured gut with three-fingered hands.<br><br>The Armorer dealt it an uppercut with the butt of his longblaster. Its round head snapped up on its stalk neck and it fell over backward. It raised a splash of foul-smelling water that was already up to the tops of J.B.'s ankles. By now the rest of the companions had left the jump chamber and were all through the anteroom and into the control room.<br><br>The other muties closed in as Ryan and Jak fanned out to the sides. Ryan stepped forward to close with a mutie slashing overhand at him. He blocked with his left forearm and hacked at the creature's upper arm with the panga.<br><br>It felt more as though the weapon was hitting dense mud or clay rather than flesh, but it struck bone. The mutie keened and struck with its left claw. Ryan kicked it in the belly, and it staggered back with thick blood oozing from the gash in its arm.<br><br>A mutie attacked from Ryan's left. Doc stepped forward and thrust his sword through the creature's head. It fell.<br><br>Four of the muties were down. The other four hung back as if uncertain. Unfortunately, they were between Ryan's group and the door.<br><br>A loud <em>crack</em> almost like thunder echoed through the facility. The floor shook once, hard, beneath Ryan's boot. Raw sewage sloshed up the walls and on the inert, dark comp stations that lined them.<br><br>A grinding squeal sounded behind Ryan's left shoulder. He snapped his head around. A section of concrete wall as high as his head split open, and a sheet of greenish-brown water shot into the control room. It splashed down.<br><br>"Aah, shit!" Mildred exclaimed as a wave of water broke as high as her waist. Ryan set his jaw against the stench. It wouldn't kill him. The muties&#x2014;or drowning in shit&#x2014;might.<br><br>The long-armed muties dithered as if unsure whether to fight or flee. In other circumstances Ryan would have been glad to have his friends hold off, saving their energy, and ammo, to see if the creatures decided to bolt.<br><br>Unfortunately, the sewage was rising rapidly now. The sulfurous smell made Ryan's eye water and his head swim.<br><br>"Power on through!" he shouted.<br><br>Following his own command, he charged ahead. He swatted a mutie in his path in the side of the head with the wide flat blade of the panga. Not because he was feeling unduly merciful, but because he didn't want the knife getting stuck.<br><br>The door leading into the corridor was jammed open. Raising a brown wave from water already up to his thighs, Ryan sloshed down the hall, beating J.B. to a staircase and pounding upward. A mutie shambled down the steps toward him from the landing above. The one-eyed man gave the trigger a double tap, and both shots hit in the creature's chest. It coughed in a very human-sounding way and fell against the wall. Ryan raced past. It didn't even try to swipe at him with its claws. Just as he reached the landing, he heard the cry from below. "Ryan!"<br><br>He stopped and looked back. J.B., Doc and Jak were all on the stairs right behind him. Mildred and Krysty stood farther down with the foul water swirling around them, trying to drag Ricky up out of the sewage. Apparently it had either knocked him down or floated him off his feet. Muties were clinging to the youth with their long arms, holding him back from escaping the flooding corridor.<br><br>Chapter Two Ryan realized that the muties seemed to be using Ricky as a flotation device rather than trying to drag him to his doom.<br><br>"I have had enough of this shit," Mildred declared. She drew her ZKR 551 handblaster, which she'd holstered to try to help Ricky. Aiming quickly, she shot both muties through their round heads. One uttered a croak of dismay as it let go and floundered back into the eddying sewage. The other threw up its arms and sank without a sound.<br><br>Ryan turned back and started moving again as the women got Ricky onto the steps. The water was following more rapidly now.<br><br>As Ryan turned on the landing to head up the next flight, Jak eeled past J.B., who halted, holding his shotgun muzzle up.<br><br>"More muties," said the albino, who'd obviously slipped ahead to scout the next floor when Ryan paused.<br><br>"Waiting for us?" Ryan asked.<br><br>Jak shook his head.<br><br>"Most sleeping," he said. "Some awake. Starting move this way."<br><br>"Push on, J.B.," Ryan said. "We can't stay here."<br><br>"On my way."<br><br>He headed up, shotgun at the ready. Ryan bulled past Jak, intent on being right on J.B.'s heels when the little man hit the next level. Jak faded back against the wall to let Ryan pass, then followed close behind.<br><br>The next level was open space. The ceiling lighting had malfunctioned, leaving alternating areas of light and dark, interspersed with a few patches of flashing illumination. The stairwell itself was unenclosed. The open space was wide enough that its actual size was indeterminate in the shadows. It suggested a parking garage, though Ryan registered quickly that that was mainly because the sturdy structural columns were exposed to view.<br><br>The air was thick, barely stirred by the redoubt's ventilation system. It smelled heavily of stale urine, feces, mildew and not-quite-human sweat.<br><br>Around him muties were stirring from what he could only think of as nests: little rough enclosures improvised of broken furniture and random scavenged material, with moldering cushions and bits of cloth for padding from the hard, bare concrete floor. Some muties began to shamble toward them, waving their arms menacingly, from a nest not twenty feet away.<br><br>J.B. raked them with two quick bursts from his Uzi, the copper-jacketed 9 mm slugs slamming the muties to the floor, where they lay clutching their guts and squalling piteously.<br><br>The noise roused the others, who came out of the well as J.B. headed up the exposed stairs.<br><br>Ryan followed J.B. tightly. He heard shots from behind.<br><br>"We're fine!" Krysty shouted as the cracking concrete echoed through the vast empty space. "Keep moving! Water's rising fast!"<br><br>Ryan moved. They hit the next landing and kept on going. A mutie turned onto the stairs from the floor above, silhouetting itself against a flickering glow from more malfunctioning overheads. It started down before registering norms were charging up.<br><br>J.B. slashed the creature with the butt of his M4000. It released an ear-splitting squeal and fell against the steel railing to the Armorer's right. J.B. raced past.<br><br>Ryan split its teardrop-shaped head with an overhand stroke of his panga in passing and never even slowed. The creature toppled backward over the railing and plummeted to the floor.<br><br>The distinctive boom of the shotgun mounted on Doc's LeMat echoed up the stairs at a volume that seemed to make the wall ripple. Ryan didn't glance back.<br><br>"No more stairs!" J.B. called out as he reached the top of the flight.<br><br>"Find us a way out, J.B.," Ryan said.<br><br>The Armorer let the M4000 fall to hang by its sling over one shoulder and scooped up the Uzi on the sling on the other. He hastily fired a short burst over the handrail. Ryan joined him.<br><br>This level was divided into rooms. A corridor ran along the near wall, while another stretched away from them at a T junction. As on the floor below, the lighting here was patchy.<br><br>By the flickering light and alternating patches of shine and shadow J.B. had just blasted a trio of muties coming at them along the corridor running away from the wall. One of them went down thrashing at the half-rotted rubber floor runners, spraying thick green blood everywhere. The others ran off twittering.<br><br>The bad news was they ducked into one of the doors standing open to both sides of the corridor.<br><br>Ryan took quick stock of their situation. They had three choices of which way to go from here&#x2014;other than back down, which wasn't happening. The corridor looked to move on to more lateral passages at either end. It was clear both ways for the moment.<br><br>"Gotta move!" Mildred's voice boomed up from the stairs beneath Ryan. "Crap's still coming. As well as a whole boatload of more muties!"<br><br>"Where is all this pressure coming from?" asked J.B. He swiveled his head constantly to make sure no new threats caught them unawares.<br><br>"Clearly, the sewage floats on water coming from a substantial body of it, whether lake, river or even ocean," Doc called up.<br><br>He punctuated his statement with two quick, echoing blasts of his .44 blaster. Then he continued unperturbedly. "Quite nearby. Possibly above us."<br><br>"Above us?" Mildred repeated. "That's great. So what if there's no way out?"<br><br>"They didn't build this place with no exit other than the mat-trans," Ryan said. "There's a way out."<br><br>"Also a way in," J.B. added. "Unless they bred those muties here. And unless they don't have to eat."<br><br>"Got too many pointy teeth for that," Ryan growled.<br><br>"Look!" Jak pointed along the corridor where the death throes of the mutie J.B. had shot were subsiding to chirps and twitches. An overhead light had come on at the far end, revealing a door with a grated window that looked suspiciously as if it led to another set of stairs.<br><br>"Go," Ryan said as another pair of shots boomed out from just below. He recognized the sound of his lover's Smith &amp; Wesson 640. Its short barrel produced more noise than muzzle energy. If Krysty was blasting, it meant the muties were getting close.<br><br>Jak was usually a master of stealth, but he set off running at full speed. His long white hair streamed out behind his head like the neck cloth of a cap.<br><br>J.B. took off after him at a trot. He'd already swapped the Uzi for the M4000.<br><br>Ryan followed, panga and SIG Sauer at the ready. Jak was clearly bent on reaching the possible exit&#x2014;at least from this level&#x2014;as fast as possible. His companions had to keep the muties from the side rooms off his back and away from themselves. And above all, they had to keep moving.<br><br>There would be no room-by-room sweep, despite the fact it was safer, to say nothing of the possible scavvy awaiting them. Right then the only thing that gave them a chance at surviving another ten minutes was speed, speed and more speed.<br><br>For a moment, Ryan thought Jak was going to run the gauntlet of open doors unscathed. Then a mutie popped out of a room to the right, just at the end.<br><br>Jak punched it across the face with the knuckleduster hilt of the trench knife he carried and never slowed. The creature reeled back out of sight, clutching itself and keening in anguish.<br><br>Jak sped to the other end of the corridor, the open doorways to either side spewing claw-waving muties in his wake.<br><br>"Fireblast!" Ryan exclaimed. "We can't shoot or we might hit him!"<br><br>He and J.B. kept charging ahead regardless. There was nothing else to do.<br><br>But Jak had grown up fighting. He knew he was in his friends' line of fire as well as they did. Through the crowd of fluting, growling, arm-waving muties blocking their way, Ryan saw the slim white figure slip aside, out of his line of sight. A moment later the boom of his .357 Magnum Colt Python reverberated down the hallway, muted only slightly by the dropped ceiling.<br><br></p><h2>Flower artists of Kew: Botanical paintings by contemporary artists</h2><p>Today&#39;s botanical artists continue a long tradition of excellence going back over many centuries. The best of their work is of great accuracy and beauty and comparable with that of the more celebrated artists of the past. This book presents a selection of botanical paintings by 19 contemporary artists who have worked at Kew. The plants depicted range from familiar wild flowers to exotic orchids and the paintings include single specimens, groups of plants and detailed analytical studies. Mary Grierson, one of the world&#39;s leading botanical painters, advised on the selection of the illustrations. Each plate is accompanied by a description of the plant and the task it presented to the artist, by the eminent botanical scholar Dr William T.Stearn, who has also contributed an introduction to the work of present-day artists and its relation to those of earlier periods. There is also a short biography of each of the artists represented.</p><p></p><h2>All Things Bright and Beautiful</h2><p>Written in 1848, this beloved hymn celebrating the wonders of Creation, is given new life in Anna Vojtech&#39;s glowing interpretation. Lushly detailed paintings follow two children and their frisky pup through a bucolic landscape of meadows, hills, rivers, streams and woods. Throughout the seasons, the youngsters explore and enjoy the wealth of treasures to be found--&#34;&#34;things bright and beautiful, great and small, wise and wonderful, the glory of it all.</p><p>First published by Cecil Frances Alexander in 1948, this favorite hymn has become a mainstay of churches and Sunday school classes everywhere. Artist Katy Hudson brings new joy to Alexander's words with her fresh and bright watercolor style. Readers can join in the fun as they follow two little girls and their brother on a day filled with the discovery of &#x201c;all things bright and beautiful.&#x201d;Cecil Frances Alexander was born in Ireland. She began writing poetry as a child and wrote nearly 400 hymns. She wrote &#34;&#34;All things Bright and Beautiful, &#34;&#34; one of her most popular, to help explain to children the opening words of the Apostles&#39; Creed, a Christian statement of belief. The wife of an archbishop, she was known to be a generous woman who cared for the poor and opened a school for the deaf with her sister.</p><h2>Values Sell: Transforming Purpose into Profit Through Creative Sales and Distribution Strategies (SVN)</h2><p>Sales and distribution are the lifeblood of any business. But how can a values-driven, socially responsible business compete with those for whom the bottom line is the only measure of success? The answer: get creative!<br> In this practical and inspiring guide, Nadine Thompson and Angela Soper draw on real-world examples--from Tom's of Maine, Seventh Generation, Honest Tea, and many other innovative companies--to detail concrete steps for designing sales and distribution strategies that fit the needs, interests, and habits of your target customers. They show how to turn your stakeholders into enthusiastic partners by ensuring that all of your relationships--with your salespeople as well as other employees, your customers, and your suppliers--are beneficial and fulfilling on more than just an economic level.</p><p>Nadine A. Thompson is not only the president, CEO, and co-founder of Warm Spirit, she is the visionary and leader of a community of over 20,000 women and men who are empowered entrepreneurs and change agents. In 1997, Nadine founded Warm Spirit with friend and entrepreneur Daniel Wolf. She was excited about the possibilities of creating a business venture that would enlighten and empower women. Warm Spirit provides access to entrepreneurial opportunities and high-quality natural products and creates wealth for the consultants and their communities. Its unique marketing plan returns approximately fifty cents from each dollar in sales back into the pockets of the consultants and therefore recycles wealth and profits directly back into these communities. In 2006, the company was named the Emerging Company of the Year by Black Enterprise magazine.<br> Angela E. Soper is a freelance writer, media consultant, and documentary filmmaker based in Salt Lake City, Utah. For nine years (1996&#x2013;2005) she worked as the creative director/screen- writer in the Visual Productions Department of Nu Skin Enterprises, a billion dollar, worldwide network-marketing company located in Provo, Utah. While she was at Nu Skin, Angela&#x2019;s work as a corporate video screenwriter won numerous awards in the industrial film category. She also cowrote the company&#x2019;s twentieth anniversary hardcover book, Journey, which was recognized in Print magazine&#x2019;s 2005 Regional Design Annual and in Graphic Design USA (June 2005). She has written for Pax Tele- vision, the Washington Post, People magazine, and the Salt Lake Tribune, as well as for regional publications in Indiana, Virginia, and Utah.THE CREATIVE CHALLENGE:<br> Using your vision to solve problems and develop new strategies for increasing sales<br><br> Seventh Generation, maker of nontoxic and environmentally safe household products, was faced with a dilemma regarding its values versus its sales when a large grocery chain that carried the company&#x2019;s products experienced a labor strike. As a company that strives to be a positive force in society, Seventh Generation had to decide whether to sell to the grocer since the strike involved health benefits. The company chose to continue to do business with the grocery chain during the strike but to donate all profits from those sales to the workers&#x2019; strike fund. This action helped Seventh Generation maintain a good relationship with the grocer&#x2019;s employees, its customers, and the grocer itself, all of which contributed to future sales.<br><br> Vision. It&#x2019;s a simple word with huge connotations in the business world. Surely for anyone who has awakened in the middle of the night with a new business idea glowing like a 100-watt bulb in her head, the vision is sparkling clear, illuminating every fiber in her body. Most of us have had such &#x201c;visionary&#x201d; moments in our lives. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t a new business idea but a new way to 2solve a problem or enhance your life or someone else&#x2019;s: an abrupt awareness of that nagging reason you couldn&#x2019;t balance the checkbook, a sudden insight into why your teenager has been giving you nasty glares for three days, the perfect way to celebrate your parents&#x2019; wedding anniversary.<br><br> There&#x2019;s no discounting such moments of blinding insight when it comes to proposing a new idea. And of course, there&#x2019;s also plenty of room for those who start with a kernel of an idea, work laboriously and painstakingly to nurture it, and allow it to germinate fully before putting it into action. However it is reached and ultimately presented, a vision can be a critical component of creating sales and distribution strategies that move a business forward. In fact, it is often the foundation for many other aspects of a business that can play a role in promoting healthy sales and distribution: marketing, customer service, personnel issues, community outreach, public relations.<br><br> In a values-driven business, or socially responsible business, the vision is the torchbearer that leads his or her team proudly over the challenging terrain of business ups and downs. Occasionally this vision may alter its route, adjust for changes in the environment or climate, or even reconfigure the long-term strategy, but it will always maintain a steady course toward the goal at hand. Vision is looking to the horizon and imagining what could be. Vision is daring to head toward that horizon with a true sense of purpose and a plan of action.<br><br> In this chapter we will give you examples of business leaders who have established clear and profitable visions as they formulated their companies and then used their visions as strategic allies in selling their products or services. These visions encompassed a socially responsible agenda but were also modeled on sound business principles that took into account a very basic rule of success: people must want what you are selling, the product 3or service must be of high quality, and consumers must want to purchase it again and again.<br><br> Whatever business you&#x2019;re in&#x2014;or hoping to create&#x2014;you will be selling. In addition to your product, you will sell your concept to potential investors, you will sell your socially responsible mission, you will sell your brand and what it stands for, and you will sell what you stand for as an individual.<br><br> Although this book is about creative sales and distribution strategies, you won&#x2019;t be able to sell effectively unless your business is grounded in a powerful vision. A clear vision will drive you forward and enable you to scale new heights. It can get you through the tough times (and all businesses have them!) and help you adjust when change is required. Lack of vision will stifle you or send you in confusing directions. And if you don&#x2019;t know where you&#x2019;re headed, your investors, your suppliers, your community, and certainly your customers will be confused and may lose confidence in your business and your product. As Angela&#x2019;s writer and attorney friend Danny Quintana says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to get where you&#x2019;re going if you know where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; 1 Your vision can be that shining, guiding star.<br><br> By establishing your vision and the actions that will support it, you will be better able to design and support strong sales and distribution strategies. First, let&#x2019;s take a look at a few socially responsible companies and the particular vision and actual business of each.<br><br> Seventh Generation makes nontoxic and environmentally safe household products. It wants to market products that save natural resources, keep toxic chemicals out of the environment, and make the world a safer place&#x2014;for generations to come. The vision is to make the world a safer, healthier place and foster social and environmental change. The business is household products.<br><br> 4<br> New Leaf Paper sells recycled paper. The vision is to inspire a fundamental shift toward environmental responsibility in the paper industry. The business is selling high-quality paper made from recycled content that can replace traditional &#x201c;new&#x201d; paper.<br><br> Hot Lips Pizza wants to be a positive influence in the community. The vision is to find new, sustainable ways of doing business as the company supports local growers. The business is selling pizza and homemade soda.<br><br> Tom&#x2019;s of Maine, the market leader in health and specialty products, has maintained a vision to do what is right for its customers, employees, communities, and environment. The business is creating and selling safe, effective products sourced in nature.<br><br> If you&#x2019;re just starting down the road of creating a values-driven business, you may occasionally run into challenges as you attempt to manage the social responsibility aspect of your venture with good business practices that boost sales. You may sometimes find it tough to keep your values aligned with day-today operations, especially if you&#x2019;re trying to change how people view your product or industry and possibly change their way of doing business.<br><br> Here we offer some Vision Strategies to help align your vision with sound business principles that will keep you headed toward increased sales.<br> VISION STRATEGY NUMBER ONE:<br> Think about how your vision and product combined can improve your customers&#x2019; business or personal lives.<br><br> Keeping a compelling story and a compelling vision in the forefront of your sales efforts can play an important role in moving your business forward. You can use this strategy to relay the message about why your product is worth purchasing and help motivate your sales force.<br><br> 5<br> As you are presenting your product (or service) to customers, it&#x2019;s important that your message be easy to understand. If you clutter your sales pitch with a complex explanation that weaves the details of your socially responsible mission with the benefits of your product, you may confuse the buyer to the point that it&#x2019;s just too much trouble for him to invest in what you&#x2019;re selling.<br><br> Another critical component of selling is listening. If you don&#x2019;t know your customer and what he needs or wants, your presentation may fall on deaf ears. Understand what you are selling and to whom you are selling it. Does your presentation need to be tailored for each customer? In other words, is Customer A likely to be more interested in the socially responsible benefits your product or business offers, and is Customer B going to be more interested in the actual product benefits? Consider how you can streamline your message so it is to the point and clear to those listening.<br><br> Here are some pointers from Jeff Mendelsohn, founder of New Leaf Paper.<br> Making It Compelling<br><br> Founded in 1998, New Leaf Paper of San Francisco, California, has grown rapidly the past few years and now does close to $20 million in annual sales. Similar companies were created in the early nineties but have since closed their doors or now operate as small regional companies. So why did New Leaf succeed when the others did not? &#x201c;I think what we did well was to break into a high commodity business with a proposition that didn&#x2019;t scare people away,&#x201d; says Jeff. &#x201c;We were able to address their business needs.&#x201d;2<br><br> One way Jeff and his staff have done this is by putting themselves in the shoes of their customers. &#x201c;Take off your save-the-world hat,&#x201d; Jeff continues, &#x201c;and put on the hat of whoever you&#x2019;re 6selling to, and think about what is going to be compelling to them.&#x201d; Of course, New Leaf has an environmental agenda, but approaching prospective customers with only this part of the mission would not make good business sense, according to Jeff. &#x201c;People have a hard time selling on more than one platform. They get caught up in the environment and then that&#x2019;s all they&#x2019;ll talk about... we&#x2019;ve always combined the environment with good business... they come out in the same breath. That&#x2019;s probably one of the reasons why we&#x2019;ve been able to be successful.&#x201d;3<br><br> Key to New Leaf&#x2019;s selling approach is keeping the combined environmental and business message extremely clean and simple. In addition, Jeff stresses the importance of taking a partnership approach to business and emphasizing win-win deals with customers. &#x201c;Listen to them very carefully,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;because, especially at the outset, your preconceived notions about what is going to sell and what is exciting to your customers will be partly right and partly wrong.&#x201d;4 By listening to your customers, you make them feel appreciated. They also have a chance to be part of your mission if you embrace them in what you&#x2019;re doing.<br><br> Combining the company&#x2019;s vision with good business practices and finding a compelling story for each customer enables New Leaf Paper to lead the industry in the development and distribution of environmentally superior printing and office pa-pers.5 Clearly, New Leaf Paper has found tremendous benefit in adding &#x201c;compelling&#x201d; to its business plan as it keeps its values-driven mission and product sales goals aligned.<br> VISION STRATEGY NUMBER TWO:<br> Align your vision with your community&#x2019;s interests.<br><br> If your business is small, the community in which you operate is probably very important to you. It may be the source of your 7employees, your customers, and even your suppliers. Therefore, your actions as a businessperson must be in tune with the needs and interests of your community because it includes the people who are supporting you. This strategy can be critical if you face a business challenge or want to sell a product or offer a service that is unfamiliar to your customers. In other words, the more trust and loyalty you develop among those in your community, the better chance you have of maintaining sales, keeping supplies on hand, and meeting shipping deadlines when challenges erupt. Developing strong relationships with those in your community is also important. Listen to their ideas and keep an open dialogue going so you can prevent small issues from turning into large problems.<br><br> &#x201c;Community&#x201d; is the key word in the next example. And it became key when the entrepreneurs took stock of their business and how they could build a company that matched their personal interest of supporting their community&#x2014;something they determined was important to them as they were taking over the reins of the family operation and were preparing to &#x201c;restart&#x201d; the business.<br><br> The players in this story encompass the entire community, which is exactly what the business owners want. The story includes local farmers who wanted to find a new market for a specific product, as well as other local growers who supply the business with organic fruits, vegetables, cheeses, and meats. It also involves vision and putting business practices into place today so the business will be one step ahead of larger, more established competitors tomorrow. Remember that your secret weapon for gaining sales in your community may be ingenuity since you probably won&#x2019;t have the advertising dollars or brand awareness of bigger competitors (such as national chains).<br><br> Keeping the community&#x2019;s interests in mind helped these entrepreneurs rebuild the business. Their actions help maintain 8customer loyalty and help the company reduce costs (which helps boost profits) by using local, fresh ingredients that don&#x2019;t have to be imported. Fresh ingredients also make a higher-quality product, which again can help retain and increase sales.<br><br> Serve Your Business by Serving Your Community<br><br> Hot Lips Pizza owners David Yudkin and his wife, Jeana Edelman, took over her family&#x2019;s struggling Portland, Oregon, business, which began as a gourmet pizza company in 1984. The enterprise lacked an infrastructure, and it grew too fast. David and Jeana managed to pay off the sizable debt that had accrued and then took stock of the business and asked themselves why they were doing it and what they wanted from it.<br><br> One of the priorities for the couple was to be a positive influence on their community. About that time, David attended a presentation by Natural Step (an international organization created to accelerate global sustainability) and was influenced by Natural Step&#x2019;s advocacy of businesses&#x2019; having a role in addressing the environmental issues of the time.<br><br> David also wanted to create a better place for his children, just as his parents and immigrant grandparents had done for him. And finally, he knew supporting his community, specifically by purchasing his ingredients from local farmers, was parallel with having a quality product. From all of this, David determined that the business&#x2019;s competitive edge was innovation, and innovation has been key to everything David has been doing since. His out-of-the-box thinking has garnered Hot Lips publicity on HBO and in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes magazine, and other publications, and it resulted in the small pizza chain receiving Portland&#x2019;s Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow BEST Business Award in 2002.6"&gt;<br><br> As David was recreating his business, a billboard promoting a major pizza chain&#x2019;s use of sun-dried tomatoes made him realize 9he had to find a creative way to offer his customers a great product. He believes an innovative approach to doing business and building sales has to be tied to real issues that are part of the community.<br><br> To help the company put its new business model into place, David adopted Natural Step&#x2019;s concept of looking upstream&#x2014;envisioning where you&#x2019;d want to be if the world were sustainable. It&#x2019;s called &#x201c;backcasting,&#x201d; according to David, and it helped him get a vision of his ultimate goals for Hot Lips and understand the steps he had to take to align his company with the future.<br><br> Serving the community by buying from the community is important to David and Jeana. Most of the ingredients for their pizzas and locally bottled soda are supplied by local farmers, and many are certified organic. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a goal of everything we do,&#x201d; says David.7 In other words, his ingredients and supplies come from local businesses, so his purchases provide direct benefit to the community.<br><br> David is also big on finding solutions to ...</p><h2>Royalists to Romantics: Women Artists from The Louvre, Versailles, and Other French National Collections</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Features some seventy-five paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings by thirty-five French women <br>artists from between 1750-1848.<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Jordana Pomeroy is the Chief Curator at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC.

This is the story of how we got there.&#39; Beartown is a small town in a large Swedish forest. For most of the year it is under a thick blanket of snow, experiencing the kind of cold and dark that brings people closer together - or pulls them apart. Its isolation means that Beartown has been slowly shrinking with each passing year. But now the town is on the verge of an astonishing revival. Everyone can feel the excitement. A bright new future is just around the corner. Until the day it is all put in jeopardy by a single, brutal act. It divides the town into those who think it should be hushed up and forgotten, and those who&#39;ll risk the future to see justice done. At last, it falls to one young man to find the courage to speak the truth that it seems no one else wants to hear. With the town&#39;s future at stake, no one can stand by or stay silent. Everyone is on one side or the other. Which side would you be on? &#39;A story about families, about friendship and loyalty, inequality, and parenthood ... A novel with a big heart&#39; Joenkoeping-Posten, Sweden &#39;Backman cements his standing as a writer of extraordinary depth&#39; Washington Times</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2017:</strong> How do I love <em>Beartown</em>? Let me count the ways. It&#x2019;s a domestic drama in which a family is pulled apart by an act of violence. It&#x2019;s a coming-of-age story for a young woman who must choose to speak out or keep silent. (And a young man, too, actually.) It&#x2019;s a slow-build thriller, opening the story with the statement that one teenager is going to put a shotgun to the head of another and pull the trigger. It&#x2019;s a cautionary tale of small-town thinking...yet at the same time celebrates how a handful of people can change a tight-knit community. <em>Beartown</em> has so much going on within its enjoyably readable pages that putting it in a literary box is all but impossible&#x2014;and indeed that is one of the many reasons readers will pass this book amongst one another with a confident &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll like this.&#x201d; As the town&#x2019;s finances decline, small, scrappy Beartown hunkers deeper into itself, proud only of its white-hot junior hockey team led by a coach whose hard-driving mantra is, simply, &#x201c;Win.&#x201d; Seizing the upcoming hockey championship could lure a new hockey academy their way and jumpstart the local economy. But the exposure of a hidden crime sweeps the hockey club into its vortex and fractures the town and longtime friendships, even as it welds together new, unlikely alliances. Once the crime is revealed, <em>Beartown</em> could have strolled down an easy trail, but Backman refuses to tread it, sidestepping the predictable as he forges a new path of soul-searching and truth-telling. There are hard moments here, and readers might find difficult discoveries in their own hearts as the people of Beartown struggle with what they hope is real but fear is not. Masterful in its storytelling and honesty, this is another winner for Backman, surpassing even his much-lauded <em>A Man Called Ove</em>. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review </em>Fredrik Backman is a Swedish blogger, columnist and author.

This would be the last Spanish exploration along the Pacific Coast after 250 years of primacy in charting those waters.</p> <p>Commanded by Dionisio Alcalea Galiano and Cayento Vald�s y Flores, and inaugurated by Alejandro Malaspina, the voyage is the origin of our knowledge of part of the coast of British Columbia and its inhabitants. The two ships stopped and spent time at Nootka prior to exploring in detail the coastline inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca and north of Vancouver, Canada.</p> <p>Called the definitive account of the voyage by Donald Cutter, noted expert on the Spanish explorations. Through painstaking research, the translator and editor identified the original manuscript account of the voyage, most likely prepared Galiano. It varies significantly from the account published in Spain in 1802, and translated into English by Cecil Jane in 1930. The variances are carefully noted and accounted for by the editor.</p> <p>Considerable ethnological data are included in the document. The ships had frequent contacts with the indigenous people along the coast, noting variations in their language, their trading techniques, their fear, friendliness or hostility towards the vessels and crew.</p> <p>George Vancouver was conducting his explorations at the same time as the Sutil and Mexicana, and the two parties joined for several days to make cooperative surveys and share information. Vancouver and his second in command, Puget, entertained the Spaniards on his ship Discovery several evenings, and their relations were extremely cordial.</p> <p>The Drawings of Jos� Cardero, an artist assigned to the expedition, depicting the natives and landscapes were a major contribution to the voyage account. Thirteen of his drawings are included in the book, in addition to portraits of the two captains and maps of the voyage.</p> <p>An extensive introduction is provided giving an historical background to the voyage, the history of the original published account, and a careful analysis of the document now published. Short biographies of the major participants are also provided.</p> <p>A glossary of place names identifying present-day terms for the Spanish locations named in the document is added for reference. Two appendices containing letters regarding preparation of the voyage account and the ship manifests also supplement the text.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>The Corrections</h2><p>After almost 50 years as a wife and mother, Enid Lambert is ready to have some fun. Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson&#39;s disease, and their children are all making catastrophes of their own lives. Enid however, has her heart set on one last family Christmas.</p><p>Jonathan Franzen's exhilarating novel <i>The Corrections</i> tells a spellbinding story with sexy comic brio, and evokes a quirky family akin to Anne Tyler's, only bitter. Franzen's great at describing Christmas homecomings gone awry, cruise-ship follies, self-deluded academics, breast-obsessed screenwriters, stodgy old farts and edgy Tribeca bohemians equally at sea in their lives, and the mad, bad, dangerous worlds of the Internet boom and the fissioning post-Soviet East. <p> All five members of the Lambert family get their due, as everybody's lives swirl out of control. Paterfamilias Alfred is slipping into dementia, even as one of his inventions inspires a pharmaceutical giant to revolutionize treatment of his disease. His stubborn wife, Enid, specializes in denial; so do their kids, each in an idiosyncratic way. Their hepcat son, Chip, lost a college sinecure by seducing a student, and his new career as a screenwriter is in peril. Chip's sister, Denise, is a chic chef perpetually in hot water, romantically speaking; banker brother Gary wonders if his stifling marriage is driving him nuts. We inhabit these troubled minds in turn, sinking into sorrow punctuated by laughter, reveling in Franzen's satirical eye: </p><blockquote> Gary in recent years had observed, with plate tectonically cumulative anxiety, that population was continuing to flow out of the Midwest and toward the cooler coasts.... Gary wished that all further migration [could] be banned and all Midwesterners encouraged to revert to eating pasty foods and wearing dowdy clothes and playing board games, in order that a strategic national reserve of cluelessness might be maintained, a wilderness of taste which would enable people of privilege, like himself, to feel extremely civilized in perpetuity. </blockquote> Franzen is funny and on the money. This book puts him on the literary map. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>". . . large-hearted and merciless, <i>The Corrections</i> is a testament to the range and depth of pleasures great fiction affords."

To counter that view, this comprehensive reference work, consisting of some 3400 entries and illustrated with 50 black-and-white illustrations, treats all of the author's work some 350 stories, poems, essays, and articles. Together with the entries covering Poe's literary works (including journalistic pieces and reviews) are factual treatments of the people, places, and events associated with him. Entries are generally short, with major works given longer treatment under the subheadings "Publishing and Dramatization History," "Characters," and "Plot Synopsis." The encyclopedia contains chronologies of the author's life and work, a directory of "Poe Research Collections," and a selective bibliography. This volume joins 13 other books in the publisher's "Literary A to Z" series. The Poe Encyclopedia (Greenwood, 1997), edited by Frederick S. Frank and Tony Magistrale, is more scholarly and more comprehensive (it contains 1900 entries, each with its own bibliography, and a massive bibliography ends the book). But its hefty price tag makes it less desirable for smaller libraries. Recommended for American literature reference collections.

They included upstanding men like Melvin Dwinnel, a teacher and a publisher, as well as the likes of James Potter Williamson, whose listed occupation was "loafer." They met in Rome, Georgia, in May 1861, and became the first regiment to enlist for the duration of the hostilities--most others held together for a single season. </p><p>United by a deep love for the land left behind and a fierce determination to fight for their homes and way of life, the men of the 8th persevered through brutal battles, miserable conditions, and dimming prospects of a Confederate victory. </p><p>Using diaries, letters home to loved ones, and other historical documents, Steven E. Woodworth follows these brave men from the red clay of Georgia, through the Battle of Bull Run, to Maryland, into the bloody battle of Gettysburg, through Tennessee and the brutal Battle of Chickamauga, and finally to their ultimate defeat at Appomattox. Through every struggle, he reveals their motivations and sometimes painful decisions, telling a story of human hopes and fears and ultimately showing this most divisive war at its most personal.</p></p><p>Every war redefines hell. <i>A Scythe of Fire</i> by Warren Wilkinson and Steven E. Woodworth follows the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment on its journey through the particular underworld of the American Civil War. The Eighth Georgia Infantry, one of the Confederacy's most fabled units, fought at both battles of Bull Run, as well as at Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, the Battle of the Wilderness, and Gettysburg, where it suffered a 55 percent casualty rate. The regiment, born of idealism, disbanded, disillusioned and embittered. (More than a few soldiers defected to the Union side.) <i>A Scythe of Fire</i> may be too overwrought ("Now, as autumn began to paint ... the Blue Ridge in scarlets and yellows, the tide of Confederate success ebbed away for a season.") and far too detailed and singly focused to hold the interest of the general reader. Many Civil War buffs, on the other hand, will find this a welcome addition to their libraries. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i><p>The men of the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment answered the Confederate call to arms in the spring of 1861, virtually at the moment that war was declared. They came from all corners of the state, some dressed in mismatched homemade uniforms, others in tailored finery. Proud and defiant, convinced that "one Southerner could whip ten Yankees," they plunged into the murderous heat of battle at Bull Run. Years later, after enduring combat's most vigorous trials in Maryland, at Gettysburg, and throughout East Tennessee and the bloody horror of the Wilderness -- their ranks severely depleted by winter and sickness and Union cannon, shot, and sword -- they were at Appomattox to witness the ultimate defeat of their beloved homeland. Few men saw more hard fighting than those of the Eighth Georgia, and their remarkable story is the history of the South at war.</p><p>A monumental work of heart and scholarship, <em>A Scythe of Fire</em> tells the remarkable story of a single regiment that held together through long years of victory, defeat, despair, and death, from the Civil War's opening salvo to the Confederate surrender. The magnificent product of meticulous research, Warren Wilkinson and Steven E. Woodworth's stirring chronicle of America's War Between the States brings the conflict alive as never before through the eyes of the courageous men who fought and died on the nation's battlefields. Based on personal accounts, diaries, letters, and other primary sources, here is a tale of bravery and fortitude; the true story of fighting men united by an intense love of their land and devotion to a way of life.</p><p>From the first heady days of the Southern secession and dreams of rapid triumph through harrowing winter marches and action in some of the fiercest conflicts of the war, <em>A Scythe of Fire</em> is the history of the Eighth Georgia as experienced by those who carried its standard into battle: doctors and farmers, land owners and simple folk, each dedicated to victory yet proud and unbroken in the face of defeat. It is a vivid, unforgettable, and profoundly human story of hope, folly, loyalty, and courage that will stand among the most acclaimed chronicles of the nation's bloodiest and most terrible epoch.</p></p><h2>Struggles and Triumphs: Or, Forty Years&#39; Recollections of P.T. Barnum (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Written with the same energy and imagination Barnum brought to all his endeavors, this autobiography is a manual on getting rich, an occasional sermon on the merits of Christianity, and a survey of popular entertainment. When the first version was published in 1855, it became an immediate bestseller. Read today, it is not only a wonderful portrait of the most colorful figure in nineteenth-century American life but also a fascinating document of his times. He schemed to entrance the American people&#x2014;to shock, amuse, and surprise them. And he succeeded. P.T. Barnum introduced the American public to Tom Thumb, the Siamese twins Chang and Eng, and the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind. He made Americans open their eyes in amazement at thousands of &#x201c;oddities,&#x201d; some real, some manufactured. <i>Struggles and Triumphs</i> is the life story of America&#x2019;s first purveyor of pop culture&#x2014;a man who indulged in outright chicanery and yet managed to retain an image (most of the time) of unassailable moral rectitude.</p><p><b>Carl Bode</b>, professor emeritus of English/American Studies at the University of Maryland, is a freelance writer.

I move my feet forward an inch and press myself into a gray overcoat that smells of wet dog. It feels as if it hasn&#x2019;t stopped raining since the start of November, and a light steam rises from the hot bodies jammed against one another. A briefcase jabs into my thigh. As the train judders around a corner I&#x2019;m held upright by the weight of people surrounding me, one unwilling hand against the gray overcoat for temporary support. At Tower Hill the carriage spits out a dozen commuters and swallows two dozen more, all hell-bent on getting home for the weekend.</p><p>&#x201c;Use the whole carriage!&#x201d; comes the announcement. Nobody moves.</p><p>The gray overcoat has gone, and I&#x2019;ve shuffled into its place, preferable because I can now reach the handrail, and because I no longer have a stranger&#x2019;s DNA on my neck. My handbag has swung round behind my body, and I tug it in front of me. Two Japanese tourists are wearing gigantic rucksacks on their chests, taking up the space of another two people. A woman across the carriage sees me looking at them; she catches my eye and grimaces in solidarity. I accept the eye contact fleetingly, then look down at my feet. The shoes around me vary: the men&#x2019;s are large and shiny, beneath pinstriped hems; the women&#x2019;s heeled and colorful, toes crammed into impossible points. Among the legs I see a pair of sleek stockings; opaque black nylon ending in stark white trainers. The owner is hidden but I imagine her to be in her twenties, a pair of vertiginous office heels stashed in a capacious handbag, or in a drawer at work.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve never worn heels during the day. I was barely out of my Clarks lace-ups when I fell pregnant with Justin, and there was no place for heels on a Tesco checkout, or coaxing a toddler up the main street. Now I&#x2019;m old enough to know better. An hour on the train on the way into work; another hour on the way home. Tripping up broken escalators. Run over by strollers and bikes. And for what? For eight hours behind a desk. I&#x2019;ll save my heels for high days and holidays. I wear a self-imposed uniform of black trousers and an array of stretchy tops that don&#x2019;t need ironing, and are just smart enough to pass as office-wear; with a cardigan kept in my bottom drawer for busy days when the door&#x2019;s forever opening and the heat disappears with every prospective client.</p><p>The train stops and I push my way onto the platform. I take the Overground from here, and although it&#x2019;s often as busy, I prefer it. Being underground makes me feel uneasy; unable to breathe, even though I know it&#x2019;s all in my head. I dream of working somewhere close enough to walk to, but it&#x2019;s never going to happen: the only jobs worth taking are in zone one; the only affordable mortgages in zone four.</p><p>I have to wait for my train and at the rack by the ticket machine I pick up a copy of the <i>London Gazette</i>, its headlines appropriately grim for today&#x2019;s date: <i>Friday, November 13</i>. The police have foiled another terrorism plot: the front three pages are rammed with images of explosives they&#x2019;ve seized from a flat in North London. I flick through photos of bearded men, and move to find the crack in the tarmac beneath the platform sign, where the carriage door will open. My careful positioning means I can slide into my favorite spot before the carriage fills up: on the end of the row, where I can lean against the glass barrier. The rest of the carriage fills quickly, and I glance at the people still standing, guiltily relieved to see no one old, or obviously pregnant. Despite the flat shoes, my feet ache, thanks to standing by the filing cabinets for most of the day. I&#x2019;m not supposed to do the filing. There&#x2019;s a girl who comes in to photocopy property details and keep the cabinets in order, but she&#x2019;s in Mallorca for a fortnight and from what I saw today she can&#x2019;t have done any filing for weeks. I found residential mixed up with commercial, and rentals muddled up with sales, and I made the mistake of saying so.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better sort it out, then, Zoe,&#x201d; Graham said. So instead of booking viewings I stood in the drafty corridor outside Graham&#x2019;s office, wishing I hadn&#x2019;t opened my mouth. Hallow &amp; Reed isn&#x2019;t a bad place to work. I used to do one day a week doing the books, then the office manager went on maternity leave and Graham asked me to fill in. I was a bookkeeper, not a PA, but the money was decent and I&#x2019;d lost a couple of clients, so I jumped at the chance. Three years later, I&#x2019;m still there.</p><p>By the time we reach Canada Water the carriage has thinned out and the only people standing are there by choice. The man sitting next to me has his legs so wide apart I have to angle mine away, and when I look at the row of passengers opposite I see two other men doing the same. Is it a conscious thing? Or some innate need to make themselves bigger than everyone else? The woman immediately in front of me moves her shopping bag and I hear the unmistakable clink of a wine bottle. I hope Simon has thought to put one in the fridge; it&#x2019;s been a long week and right now all I want to do is curl up on the sofa and watch telly.</p><p>A few pages into the <i>London Gazette </i>some former <i>X Factor </i>finalist is complaining about the &#x201c;pressures of fame,&#x201d; and there&#x2019;s a debate on privacy laws that covers the best part of a page. I&#x2019;m reading without taking in the words: looking at the pictures and scanning the headlines so I don&#x2019;t feel completely out of the loop. I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I actually read a whole newspaper, or sat down to watch the news from start to finish.</p><p>It&#x2019;s always snatches of <i>Sky News</i> while I&#x2019;m eating breakfast, or the headlines read over someone&#x2019;s shoulder on the way in to work.</p><p>The train stops between Sydenham and Crystal Palace. I hear a frustrated sigh from farther up the carriage but don&#x2019;t bother looking to see who it&#x2019;s from. It&#x2019;s already dark and when I glance at the windows all I see is my own face looking back at me; even paler than it is in real life, and distorted by rain. I take off my glasses and rub at the dents they leave on either side of my nose. We hear the crackle of an announcement but it&#x2019;s so muffled and heavily accented there&#x2019;s no telling what it was about. It could have been anything from signal failure to a body on the line.</p><p>I hope it&#x2019;s not a body. I think of my glass of wine, and Simon rubbing my feet on the sofa, then feel guilty that my first thought is about my own comfort, not the desperation of some poor suicidal soul. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not a body. Bodies are for Monday mornings, not Friday evenings, when work is a blissful three days away.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a creaking noise and then silence. Whatever the delay is, it&#x2019;s going to be a while.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a good sign,&#x201d; the man next to me says.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; I say noncommittally. I carry on turning the pages of my newspaper, but I&#x2019;m not interested in sport and now it&#x2019;s mostly adverts and theater reviews. I won&#x2019;t be home till after seven at this rate; we&#x2019;ll have to have something easy for tea, rather than the baked chicken I&#x2019;d planned. Simon cooks during the week, and I do Friday evening and the weekend. He&#x2019;d do that too, if I asked him, but I couldn&#x2019;t have that. I couldn&#x2019;t have him cooking for us&#x2014;for my children&#x2014;every night. Maybe I&#x2019;ll pick up a takeaway.</p><p>I skip over the business section and look at the crossword, but I don&#x2019;t have a pen with me. So I read the adverts, thinking I might see a job for Katie&#x2014;or me, come to that, although I know I&#x2019;ll never leave Hallow &amp; Reed. It pays well and I know what I&#x2019;m doing now, and if it weren&#x2019;t for my boss it would be perfect. The customers are nice, for the most part. They&#x2019;re generally start-ups looking for office space, or businesses that have done well, ready for a bigger place. We don&#x2019;t do much residential, but the flats above the shops work for the first-time buyers and the downsizers. I meet a fair number of recently separateds. Sometimes, if I feel like it, I tell them I know what they&#x2019;re going through.</p><p>&#x201c;Did it all turn out okay?&#x201d; the women always ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Best thing I ever did,&#x201d; I say confidently. It&#x2019;s what they want to hear.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t find any jobs for a nineteen-year-old wannabe actress, but I turn down the corner on a page with an advert for an office manager. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt to know what&#x2019;s out there. For a second I imagine walking into Graham Hallow&#x2019;s office and handing in my notice, telling him I won&#x2019;t put up with being spoken to like I&#x2019;m dirt on the sole of his shoe. Then I look at the salary printed under the office manager position, and remember how long it&#x2019;s taken me to claw my way up to something I can actually live on. Better the devil you know, isn&#x2019;t that what they say?</p><p>The final pages of the <i>Gazette </i>are all compensation claims and finances. I studiously avoid the ads for loans&#x2014;at those interest rates you&#x2019;d have to be mad or desperate&#x2014;and glance at the bottom of the page, where the chatlines are advertised.</p><p>Married woman looking for discreet casual action. Txt ANGEL to 69998 for pics.</p><p>I wrinkle my nose more at the exorbitant price per text than the services offered. Who am I to judge what other people do? I&#x2019;m about to turn the page, resigned to reading about last night&#x2019;s football match, when I see the advert below &#x201c;Angel&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>For a second I think my eyes must be tired; I blink hard but it doesn&#x2019;t change anything.</p><p>I&#x2019;m so absorbed in what I&#x2019;m looking at that I don&#x2019;t notice the train start up again. It sets off suddenly and I jerk to one side, putting my hand out automatically and making contact with my neighbor&#x2019;s thigh.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine&#x2014;don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d; He smiles and I make myself return it. But my heart is thumping and I stare at the advert. It bears the same warning about call charges as the other boxed adverts, and a 0809 number at the top of the ad. A web address reads: <i>www.FindTheOne.com</i>. But it&#x2019;s the photo I&#x2019;m looking at. It&#x2019;s cropped close to the face, but you can clearly see blonde hair and a glimpse of a black strappy top. Older than the other women pimping their wares, but such a grainy photo it would be hard to give a precise age.</p><p>Except I know how old she is. I know she&#x2019;s forty.</p><p>Because the woman in the advert is me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>Kelly Swift stood in the middle of the Central line carriage, shifting to one side to keep her balance as the train took a bend. A couple of kids&#x2014;no more than fourteen or fifteen years old&#x2014;jostled onto the train at Bond Street, engaged in competitive swearing that jarred with their middle-class vowels. Too late for after-school clubs, and it was already dark outside; Kelly hoped they were on their way home, not heading out for the evening. Not at their age.</p><p>&#x201c;Fucking mental!&#x201d; The boy looked up, his swagger giving way to self-consciousness as he saw Kelly standing there. Kelly assumed the sort of expression she remembered her mother sporting on many an occasion, and the teenagers fell silent, blushing furiously and turning away to examine the inside of the closing doors. She probably was old enough to be their mother, she thought ruefully, counting backward from thirty and imagining herself with a fourteen-year-old. Several of her old school friends had children almost that age; Kelly&#x2019;s Facebook page regularly filled up with proud family photos, and she&#x2019;d even had a couple of friend requests from the kids themselves. Now, there was a way to make you feel old.</p><p>Kelly caught the eye of a woman in a red coat on the opposite side of the carriage, who gave a nod of approval at the effect she&#x2019;d had on the lads.</p><p>Kelly returned her look with a smile. &#x201c;Good day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better now it&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Roll on the weekend, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working. Not off till Tuesday.&#x201d; <i>And even then only one day off before another six on the trot</i>, she thought, inwardly groaning at the thought. The woman looked aghast. Kelly shrugged. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s got to, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess so.&#x201d; As the train slowed down for Oxford Circus, the woman began moving toward the doors. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a quiet one for you.&#x201d;</p><p><i>That&#x2019;s jinxed it</i>, Kelly thought. She glanced at her watch. Nine stops to Stratford: ditch her stuff, then head back. Home by eight, maybe eight thirty. In again for seven a.m. She yawned hard, not bothering to cover her mouth, and wondered if there was any food at home. She shared a house near Elephant and Castle with three others, whose full names she knew only from the rent checks pinned neatly to the board in the hall, ready for collection each month. The sitting room had been converted to a bedroom by a landlord keen to maximize his income, leaving the small kitchen the one communal area. There was only room for two chairs, but her housemates&#x2019; shift patterns and erratic hours meant Kelly could go days without seeing anyone at all. The woman in the biggest bedroom, Dawn, was a nurse. Younger than Kelly, but far more domesticated, Dawn occasionally left a portion for Kelly on the side by the microwave, with one of her bright pink Post-it notes telling Kelly to <i>help yourself! </i>Her stomach rumbled at the thought of food, and she glanced at her watch. The afternoon had been busier than she&#x2019;d thought; she was going to have to put in some extra hours next week, or she&#x2019;d never get through it all.</p><p>A handful of businessmen got on at Holborn and Kelly cast a practiced eye over them. At first glance they looked identical, with their short hair, dark suits, and briefcases. The devil was in the detail, Kelly thought. She searched out the faint pinstripe; the title of a book pushed carelessly into a bag; wire-framed glasses with a kink in one arm; a brown leather watch strap beneath a white cotton shirtsleeve. The idiosyncrasies and appearance tics that made them stand out in a lineup of near-identical men. Kelly watched them openly, dispassionately. She was just practicing, she told herself, not caring when one of them looked up and found her cool gaze on him. She thought he might look away, but instead he winked, his mouth moving into a confident smile. Kelly&#x2019;s eyes flicked to his left hand. Married. White, well-built, around six foot tall, with a shadow around his jaw that probably wasn&#x2019;t there a few hours ago. The yellow flash of a forgotten dry-cleaning tag on the inside of his overcoat. Standing so straight she&#x2019;d put money on ex-military. Nondescript in appearance, but Kelly would know him if they met again.</p><p>Satisfied, she turned her attention to the latest influx of passengers, getting on at Bank and filtering through the carriage to find the remaining few seats. Almost everyone had a phone in their hand: playing games, listening to music, or simply clutching it as though grafted to their palm. At the other end of the carriage someone lifted their phone in front of them and Kelly instinctively turned away. Tourists, getting an iconic shot of the London Underground to show back home, but she found the idea of being background scenery in someone&#x2019;s holiday snaps too weird to contemplate.</p><p>Her shoulder ached where she&#x2019;d slammed into a wall, taking the corner too tight as she ran down the escalators and onto the platform at Marble Arch. She&#x2019;d been seconds too late, and it annoyed her that the blooming bruise on her upper arm was in vain. She&#x2019;d be quicker next time.</p><p>The train pul...</p></p><h2>Alamosa, Salida &amp; the Valley Line (Narrow Gauge Collection)</h2><p>Volume 4 in Richard Dorman&#39;s authoritative pictorial history of the Rio Grande Southern.

Filled with anecdote and insight, this book provides readers with an illuminating new way to see and enjoy the movies.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchOne of Europe's most distinguished screenwriters offers a philosophical rumination on his chosen medium, but those led by the title to expect a glimpse into the hidden world of filmmaking will be disappointed. Film is an art that has evolved at a highly accelerated rate. As Carri&#x160;re points out, movies have crammed into less than a century the same process of artistic development that led painting from the walls of the caves of Lascaux to the work of the great modern artists. The result, combined with the intense proliferation of television and videotape, is that we are bombarded relentlessly with images. Even film itself is moving faster, he writes, with quick-cutting moving from rock videos to the big screen at an alarming rate. Today, Carri&#x160;re argues, visual Muzak surrounds us constantly, and the image is increasingly devalued. Much of the book is taken up with his thoughts on this phenomenon, which he finds quite disturbing. Elsewhere, Carri&#x160;re talks about the ways in which film alters our sense of time, the subterfuges by which film editing expands or compresses ``real time'' into reel time. He also offers an essay on the process by which a screenplay becomes a film, but there is little of practical value here. The author is at his most engaging when he recalls his early apprenticeship under Jacques Tati and some moments from his 19-year collaboration with Luis Bu�uel. Unfortunately, his attempt at film history is filled with generalizations that won't stand up to serious scrutiny, repeating stories that have been disproved by the scholarship of people like Charles Musser and John Fell. Despite that, the book is engaging, and Carri&#x160;re's tone--witty, self-effacing, and concerned- -manages to be at once disturbing and soothing, a rare combination indeed. Deserves a place on a small shelf alongside such oddities as Bresson's Notes on Cinematography and Tarkovsky's Sculpting in Time, studies in the philosophy of film written by great practitioners of the art. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.
